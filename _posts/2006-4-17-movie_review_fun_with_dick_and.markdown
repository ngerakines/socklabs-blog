    Movie Review: Fun with Dick and Jane
---

Rating: 3 of 5

Carolyn and I rented <em>Fun with Dick and Jane</em> from Blockbuster this afternoon and it was surprisingly good. It was better than we had both expected and it was humor with a definite twist.

Don't waste the bandwidth downloading this one, go spend 5 dollars at the local movie rental and watch it. While it does have the standard Jim Carey style of comedy, for better or worse, it was indeed entertaining without making your feel like your IQ dropped.
