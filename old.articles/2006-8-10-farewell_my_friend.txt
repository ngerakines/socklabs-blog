Melee Gerakines: Unknown to August 10th, 2006

Yesterday Carolyn and I made it to one of her doctor appointments at 3:30 in San Francisco. More on that in <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/dadhood">Dadhood</a>. When we met up she had told me that Melee was acting really weird and she was getting worried.

The evening progressed and we didn't really get home until around 9:00 pm. It was later that night that Melee just lied down and started to breathe really heavy. Carolyn became very nervous and I knew what I had to do.

I took him to the animal hospital and explained the situation and his condition. It didn't take long until he was gone and I felt very sad and relieved.

Goodbye Melee.
