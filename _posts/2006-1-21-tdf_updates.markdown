    TDF Updates
---

In the spirit of things, I've updated <a href="http://thedavidsonfamily.org">http://thedavidsonfamily.org</a> using iWeb. I went with a simple theme and we will see how it goes. I'm kinda enjoying the simplicity of it all. What is unfortunate is that if any of the family members want to update the site they have to go through me, but I'll figure out a way to work around that later.
