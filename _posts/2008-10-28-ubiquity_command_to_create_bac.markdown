    Ubiquity command to create BackPack reminders
---

I've been using [Ubiquity](http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/ubiquity/) more and more lately. The most recent use is for [BackPack](http://www.backpackIT.com/?referrer=NICKGERAKINES) integration through the available [API](http://developer.37signals.com/backpack/index.shtml). This command allows you to create really quick reminders by creating a "reminder" command. It took about 20 minutes to read through the docs and figure out what needed to be done and overall I'm impressed with how easy it is to add functionality to it. I wonder how easy it would be to integrate intranet/corporate functionality.

To use this command open the "command-editor" using the Ubiquity prompt and enter this into text area. You'll have to update the three variables at the top of the script before you can use it.
