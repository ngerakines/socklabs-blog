    Using Google Notebook
---

There has been a lot of buzz in the air about Google buying <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and the release of <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, but I've found another Google product that I think hasn't gotten enough attention: <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">Google Notebook</a>.

If I had one gripe or complaint it would be that you can't nest notes and create nested outlines, but all-in-all I love it. I've already created a few notebooks for different things like baby development notes or roadmaps. I think it works excellent just the way it is.
