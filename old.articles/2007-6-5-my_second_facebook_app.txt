    My second facebook app
---

Today my second Facebook app went out and so far the reception has been great. You can read the official blog post on the del.icio.us blog <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2007/06/face_hugger.html">here</a>.

Thanks go out to everyone on the del.icio.us team and especially Josh Whiting who helped get this out so quickly.
