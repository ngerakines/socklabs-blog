title: Deciding on a new phone
---

I'll be getting a new phone in the near future and deciding on which to get is proving to be difficult. I've been using a first generation iPhone for a while. The experience with it has been overwhelmingly good but I want to see what else is out there. It's come down to one of these now: iPhone 3G, Blackberry or Android device.

This is what I'm basing my choice on:

 * I want to be able to send and receive email. I use Google Apps to manage gerakines.net, so something that ties into Gmail is preferable.
 * I want to easily send and receive text messages. This includes things like twitter, but also automated system messages.
 * I want to **easily** sync contacts between the device and my computer. Syncing with a service like HighRise is preferable.
 * The web browser has to be good. I don't want to be stuck with a crappy wep interface.
 * 3G/WiFi support. I'm coming from 2G, being an AT&T subscriber, so I'd like to either switch to 3G or be able to use WiFi off and on.
 * I want to be able to find and use 3rd party applications.

Less important / perks:

 * I'd be nice to be able to listen to music on it. I've got an iPod that I keep with me, so this isn't terribly important.
 * I'd be nice to have GPS map software, not required though.

The seemingly obvious choice is to upgrade to an iPhone 3G. The iPhone 3G is in the lead right now because it does nearly everything that I want and I'm already familiar with it. I've also got experience developing apps for it, which is a big bonus. What I don't want to do is spend a fortune on buying one without extending my contract with AT&T by another two years. That is really unattractive right now and is one of the biggest things holding me back from getting one. I haven't been terribly unhappy with AT&T for any particular reason, but I don't like the company and I've been trying to get rid of my dependancies on them. The first step was Comcast, the second was Vonage, the third is not using Cingular (AT&T Wireless).

Having a Blackberry sounds appealing. I've heard that it's support for email and messaging sets the standard for everyone else. The Blackberry Storm is pretty sexy and does what I want. It's gotten good reviews but definitely has it's limitations. Engadget has a [really good review](http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/19/blackberry-storm-review/) that answers a lot of questions and raises some concerns. I suspect that the main thing holding me back is the lack of WiFi support and app store-like service. I've also read, from Engadget as well as others, that the interface isn't as slick and using it feels a bit rigid.

The G1 is another contender. I've never been one to shy away from first generation devices (my iPhone is a first gen) and the Android G1 is no exception. Although I've read a lot of [mixed reviews](http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/t-mobile-g1-review/), I think the G1 would make a great phone. It's got all of the features that I'm looking for as well as the perks. The downside to using one of these is that it's off-network for me. I've seen that you can buy a unlocked developer phone, but that's not what I have in mind. There have been a few cases where people have been [using it in an unactived mode](http://www.loveforbiz.com/getting-started-with-an-unactivated-t-mobile-g1) that is good for doing everything but making calls. Would this be worth moving over to T-Mobile? I've used T-Mobile in the past and my general experience was good. I'm not opposed to this at all.

I've also read about the [Kogan Agora](http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/12/03/kogan-intros-worlds-second-android-phone-agora-agora-pro/), another Android device, coming out in late January. It looks much more attractive than the G1, but is still vaporware. Until I see someone holding it and telling me how awesome it is, pictures don't really do it for me.

For now, I'll just continue to wait. My current iPhone is on it's death bed and I'm not sure how long it'll last. It's got a small crack in the upper-right corner of the screen, the plastic on the bottom-right speaker is  gone and the home button sticks. If you've got a 3g, G1 or Blackberry **please** [email me](mailto:nick+post200812203@gerakines.net) and let me know how you feel about it.
