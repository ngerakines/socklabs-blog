    Again, the industry leads the way
---

Again and again its been scene that the adult industry has to adopt something before it ever gets big on the web. Ladies and gentlemen, but mostly gentlemen, take a look at <a href="http://www.socialporn.com/">socialporn.com</a>. This is not safe for work and may offend you, but its an interesting mix of web 2.0 technologies and ideas like communal submission ( no pun intended ) and voting, commenting and so forth. Is this a sign, or something to just pass the time?
