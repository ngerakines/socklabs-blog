    CloudNine-Delicious?
---

Now that my blog is on my own machine and I'm hosting it myself, I've got a lot of flexibility with what plugins I use and whatnot. One of the things that looks especially interesting is while on an individual archive page being able to get all of the tags people have tagged that url on delicious.

When MT 3.3 came out it really rocked the house. It has an expanded plugin architecture, better build support and much to my enjoyment, tags. I love tagging and folksonomies. I think that user contributed meta-data driven content is really where things are going. But my gripe with blogging platforms is that everything is still read only. Visitors and comments don't have the ability to tag entries and they are allowed a very limited amount of interaction with websites.

Is anyone interested in something like this?
