Aye, today be International Talk Like a Pirate Day! Tis a fine holiday for the pirate in all of us. Unpack your trusty eye patch and whip out your peg to celebrate the love of pirates with the rest of the world.

Monday went by quickly, as most do. Work went well and I accomplished everything that I needed to and hit my mark. Since I went in early (like 7:30a) I decided to take the 5:00 train and head home a bit earlier than usual. A new issue of Science News Weekly arrived and I did some reading on the train. It had some really great articles. When I got home Carolyn suggested that we go out for a walk down the Stevens Creek trail.

I crashed early last night ( aka before 10:30pm ) and missed a really special episode of The Daily Show with guest Bill Clinton. Thankfully we've got Tivo and I'm looking forward to it tonight.

Today I've got a lot to do. Carolyn has a doctor appointment but her mom is going with her this time. Apparently yesterday Sharon's car wouldn't start while they were at a gas station. From what Carolyn told me it sounds like a dead or almost dead battery. It could also use a tune-up too. Anyway, they rented something for today and will probably go out to lunch before the appointment. I'm jealous, the city has such good food.

Today is also the <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2248445.html">MogileFS Summit</a>. I'll be sitting in and its going to be a lot of fun.

I've got no plans for tonight, aside from watching The Daily Show, and might run out to pick up a book.
