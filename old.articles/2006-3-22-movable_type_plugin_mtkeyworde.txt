    Movable Type plugin: MT-KeywordExtractor
---

The module WWW::Yahoo::KeywordExtractor was indirectly written for a plugin idea that I had a few weeks ago. I'd like to introduce the plugin <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/keywordextractor/">KeywordExtractor</a>. This simple plugin attaches to the post_save hook in MovableType to submit your post content to the Yahoo Keyword Extractor API to provide you with relevant keywords. See the project blog for more information.
