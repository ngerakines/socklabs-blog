I saw a post on <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg.com</a> today that showed some really impressive of Wine vs Windows XP and Wine really kicked some ass. Its amazing to think that they've got an emulator actually beating the OS that it is trying to copy. Whats even better is that this is with the initial Wine fork, not the <a href="http://www.transgaming.org">TransGaming</a> version which has a steady upward trend of performance and cool features.
