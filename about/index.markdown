"<i>Nick Gerakines is a certified Erlang badass.</i>" -- <cite><a href="http://github.com/blog/321-github-rebase-12">GitHub Rebase #12</a></cite>

I'm an author, software engineer and dad and occasionally I find time to write about life, the internet and anything else that crosses my mind. I'm a native new-orleanian turned californian and have lived on the west coast since the turn of the century. I love to program, write and spend time with my family.

I'm pretty active on the usual social places including [GitHub](http://github.com/ngerakines), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/snipersock/), [twitter](http://twitter.com/ngerakines) and  [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ngerakines). I prefer [email](mailto:nick@gerakines.net) over instant messaging but will also respond to Facebook messages.

I fall into the 'hardcore gamer' category and have been know to hang-out on [Medivh-US](http://apps.facebook.com/iplaywow/realm/Medivh-US) playing the World of Warcraft character [Korale](http://apps.facebook.com/iplaywow/character/Medivh-US/Korale). I've been featured on one of [WoW Insider's 15 Minutes of Fame](http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/02/04/15-minutes-of-fame-i-play-wow-for-facebook/) as well as [a few](http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/07/08/i-play-wow-on-facebook/) [others](http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/01/16/i-play-wow-facebook-app-reaches-100-000-users/). Lately I've been really into Aion Online and even Battlefield 1943. You can get an idea of what I'm up to on my [Rupture profile](http://www.rupture.com/ngerakines).
