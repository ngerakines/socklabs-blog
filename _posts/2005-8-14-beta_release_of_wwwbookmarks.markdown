    Beta release of WWW::Bookmarks
---

I'd like to announce the acceptance of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/WWW-Bookmarks/">WWW::Bookmarks</a> on CPAN. WWW::Bookmarks is a perl based OO interface to any Bookmarks server. An example of such is <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/">http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/</a>. It makes use of the XMLRPC interface provided by the servers and adds a few things here and there for ease of use. Right now what is on CPAN is considered a beta release and only covers some basic features, although as soon as things settle down I have alot of plans to seriously expand its capabilities.
