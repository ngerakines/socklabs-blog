    The Mandatory Thanksgiving Post
---

This is the required thanksgiving post that every blog has in one way or another. I'm at starbucks because my phone is dead and my internet connection at the place that I'm staying is fuzzy. Uggg.

I've got to admit that the days before and event the day of, wasn't that exciting. Dinner was good, no real suprise, and sleep came very close afterward.

Although, the few days before I foolishly did a 40+ hour push and really hurt afterward. It was productive, but foolish. Work has been really good and I've gotten a lot done. We are steadily adding more and more feeds every day and it looks like we'll have another huge batch to be added some time next week.

On a complete side note, James and I are doing some very cool development. I'll post more as it comes, but we've got an idea that will ( hopefully ) get some buzz stiring. Keywords are Email, Podcasts, Feeds, Storage, and Video.

This weekend is going really well. I had lunch with <a href="http://www.pleonast.com/susan">Susan</a> yesterday at Rudys. Always good company. We havn't really talked in a while and it felt good to catch up.

Sunday will be the most exciting though. I'll be driving up to San Francisco from Los Angeles in my mustang. I've been wanting to bring it up for a while and I finally have the chance. I went over to my storage space today and grabbed what cloths I could find as well as a few other things. I'm going to pack tonight and get ready, then tomorrow morning start the drive. I'm really excited.
