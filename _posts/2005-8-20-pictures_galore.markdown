    Pictures galore
---

I found a bunch of pictures that were on my computer and took the opportunity to upload them to the site. It took a while because there was over 100 of them, but some of them were kinda small and it worked out well. I've got a lot of random pictures as well as a few here and there of my friends and family. As soon as I'm settled I'll probly post a bunch of shots that I took while I was in SF. That should be a lot of fun.
