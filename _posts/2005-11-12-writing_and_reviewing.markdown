    Writing and Reviewing

Over at <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a> we've made a lot of progress over the past few days and we think we've really touched some major issues. These are mostly improvements that people will never see, but look carefully because there are some subtle changes peeking through.

For the curious we've got a pretty cool feature in the works. As <a href="http://scott.feedster.com/">Scott mentioned</a>, as of right now on some selected search terms you might see a link with a star next to it. We call these 'Profiled Search Terms' and allow us to create some very cool mappings between given search terms and definite and legitimate sources. This feature has actually been around for a while now, however what we've done is created a mildly intelligent system behind it and it looks to be very useful so far. <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=nick+gerakines">Example: Nick Gerakines</a>, <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=friend+of+a+friend">Example: Friend of a friend</a>

On my side of things we've been looking at several different ways of handling things. I must admit that the books that I've been reading and referencing lately have filled my head with a lot of crazy and radical ideas. I think that in the not-to-far future you will see some definitely cool ideas and features move into action.

Lastly, I've had a small sneak peek at the updated user interface and it looks hot. Maybe I'll sneak a screen cap for the world.

I'll have book additional reviews and idea rants to follow.
