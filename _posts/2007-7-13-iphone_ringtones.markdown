    iPhone ringtones
---

I found a link on the del.icio.us hotlist today about <a href="http://www.hacktheiphone.com/iphone_ringtone_installation.html">adding custom ringtones to your iPhone</a> that looked very interesting. I decided to give it a shot and it worked very well. I used several of the tunes from Zelda: Ocarina of Time and they fit in very nicely. I'm very pleased with myself.
