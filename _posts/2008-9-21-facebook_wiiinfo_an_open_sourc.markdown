    facebook_wiiinfo, an open source Facebook application
---

This evening I saw that a friend of mine posted his Wii code and Mario Cart code on Twitter and that inspired me to find a way to display my own Wii code on Facebook. Much to my surprise I only saw two applications in my search for "wii" and neither of them looked like they did what I wanted them to. Thus, the challenge.

With that said, I'd like to announce [Wii Info](http://apps.new.facebook.com/wiiinfo/), an open source Facebook application written in Erlang. Although this isn't my first Facebook application written in Erlang (I Play WoW, KeyRing, etc), this is the first one that I'm making open source under the MIT license.

The only feature that it has is the ability to set a Wii code in the Info tab of your Facebook profile. Show your support by adding the application or forking the project. The README.markdown file has more information on deploying it yourself.
