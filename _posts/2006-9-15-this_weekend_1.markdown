    This weekend
---

I don't think I have any other set plans this weekend. On Sunday is 'girls day' so Carolyn will be gone most of it and I'll get the house to myself. I should be able to get some work done and even have some spare time to zone out and just veg for a little while. That doesn't sound so bad, I've been really stressed lately.

I got to talk to Aaron a few days ago, he's doing really well. I don't know what happened but there was some disconnect with his scheduled kidney donor that threw off his schedule but he sounded optimistic that in the near future something will turn up. I sure do hope so.
