    Ugg. And once again: Ugg

The sore throat of last week has turned into a full blown cold. Home sick, never fun when sick. I'd rather be at work.. working, but when you need to heal you need to heal.

Soo I work from home, in the comfort of my warm and soothing electric blanket. I've got a pretty sizable todo list and have been hacking away since I got home. There are some pretty big changes coming up, not just with the crawler.

Anyway, I've said to much. Keep tuned for the cool things that we have in store for Feedster.
