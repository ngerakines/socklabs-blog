    Surprise!
---

This afternoon I came home to find Carolyn, Sharon and Melissa all hanging out in the living room. I sat along the floor and noticed a cat carrier and some other stuff, but with Merlin (the family cat) spending the night while they are in Las Vegas, I just shrugged it off. About 5 minutes later Sharon called from the back saying that the door to the bathroom was stuck. Quite confused, I got up to head back to see what she was talking about to find ...

Two Kittens in the bathroom! They had gone out earlier in the afternoon to PetCo and got two 10 week old kittens! I'd like to introduce <a href="http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=6577923">Picasso</a> and <a href="http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=6512082">Melee</a>.
