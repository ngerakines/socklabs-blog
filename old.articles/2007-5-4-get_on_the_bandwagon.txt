    Get on the bandwagon

I just want to give a quick shout-out to the folks working on <a href="http://ridethebandwagon.com/">Bandwagon</a>. Ever since the service was brought back they've been working really hard to resolve all of my bug reports, crash reports and general questions. If you aren't using <a href="http://ridethebandwagon.com/">Bandwagon</a>, you should. It rocks.
