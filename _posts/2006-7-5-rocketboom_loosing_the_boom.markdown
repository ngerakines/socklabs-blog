    Rocketboom: Loosing the Boom
---

I saw this morning that Amanda Congdom will no longer be the anchor for Rocketbook, a highly popular videoblog. WTF? Amanda Congdon <em>is</em> Rockboom and it will never be the same without her. I've already unsubscribed and archived the old episodes. I hope she decides to do something similar on her own, she really carries whatever show she is on.

Andrew Baron is an idiot. Plain and simple.
