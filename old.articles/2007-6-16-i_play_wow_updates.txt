I made a few small but noticable changes last night.

Now you can search for and list characters by realm, class, race, guild and level.

The character profile boxes have a uniform and cleaner look. The character's level is also displayed on along with the race and class. The level, race, class, realm and optional guild all link to the search page which is publicly accessible.

On the I Play WoW Application page in addition to displaying your characters it also displays the characters that your friends have. I'm trying to make it as easy as possible to connect with your World of Warcraft friends.
