		 	<p>This weekend has been unexplainably productive. On Friday I made some calls and arranged some apartment viewing appointments in Mountain View, so on Saturday we got up kinda early and headed south. We only actually saw 2 of the apartments that we had planned on viewing, one of which was spontaneous.</p>

<p>There was one described as a 'cottage' which I kinda liked, but it didn't have any real yard and was backed up against a complex. It was pretty nice and had hardwood floors but Carolyn wasn't too impressed. The other one was part of a larger complex. The outside wasn't <em>great</em> but once you stepped in the door it really opened up. I was mildly impressed.</p>

<p>One of the ones we didn't see was really weird to us. We had arranged to view the place at 1:00 pm and made it a minute or so early. We had talked to them 2 or 3 hours earlier and made sure it was available and ready for us to see. When we got there, the lady was acting strange and, what felt like was on a whim, said that she had rented it already. It really struck us as odd because she immediately said we could go see it still if we wanted to.</p>

<p>The last place was at 1:45 pm. We drove by but the surround apartments and area felt really ghetto and rundown so we left.</p>

<p>On our way home we stopped at Carolyn's first love, Ikea. Carolyn explained that she felt like we should wait to get a few of the things we liked because we will be moving soo soon, but we did pick up a few essentials.</p>

<p>Mainly boxes for old cloths and whatnot.</p>

<p>We made it home and made the house into something new. That really isn't an exaggeration. We spent well until 9:00 pm cleaning and organizing and the results were mind blowing. Its really amazing what a few small things can really do for you. We also did 6 loads of laundry, which included the new sheets and bedding.</p>

<p>We finally settled down and get ready for bed. I started watching the movie <em>Weather Man</em> but turned it off about half way through because it lost my interest.</p>
