    Freakish amounts of spam
---

Recently I've been under fire, well, my site has been I should say. Within the past few days and weeks I've had about 5,000+ spam comments posted. Its very nice to say that the spam filtering system that I have going, along with a bit of help from iptables, most of it is kept at bay. Through all of this I found that trackbacks weren't being checked under the spam filter but that was quickly fixed. For the other [SockWiki:Drupal] users out there who might be dealing with the same issue, check out <a href='http://drupal.org/project/trackback'>this</a> and <a href='http://drupal.org/node/16690'>this</a> for tips and information.

And by the way, this site is still spam free you bastards.
