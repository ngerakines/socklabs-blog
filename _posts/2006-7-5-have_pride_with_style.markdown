I checked the mailbox on the way to work this morning and found that 2 of the packages that I've been expecting arrived. One of them was a book that I picked up off of Amazon and the other was my order from <a href="http://www.dirtycoast.com/">Dirty Coast</a>.

I ordered a few shirts (ok 5) that I really liked. They also sent a stack of stickers with the title 'Be A New Orleanian' and the subtitle 'wherever you are'

Pictures to come soon.
