		 	<p>Yeah, thats right, blog-a-licious. <em>shrugs</em></p>

<p>Almost caught up on season two of ER. Slowly but surely I'll get to season 4. Maybe by then season 5 will be out on DVD. Could probably find all of them online somewhere.</p>

<p>Another episode of Lost comes out tonight. Looking forward to it. Will try to find the HDTV torrent for that one though. I really like watching it on the TV and not my laptop. Feels more appropriate.</p>

<p>Carolyn said she's been having fun at starbucks. I'm glad she's liking it.</p>

<p>On the tech side of things my mail client <em>Mail.app</em> has been randomly crashing. I'm wondering if I've hit some sort of unknown limit with message count but that almost seems unrealistic. It happens when its downloading messages from my pop3 server. I'll post the error sooner or later. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>In light of Mail.app crashing I'm giving serious thought to switching to thunderbird or Entourage. Thunderbird I used a while ago on a linux desktop box and had good times. Entourage I tried about 20 minutes ago and started feel claustrophobia.</p>

<p>Some users may have noticed that the site was down for a few hours in the beginning of the week. This was due to my bill lapsing. Arg, I'll admit it. When my wallet was stolen a few weeks ago I had my credit card canceled and replaced and I forgot to update my billing information. It happens, Woops.</p>

<p>Site traffic and stats have been looking good. Google pagerank has been steadily increasing over the past few months and I'm pretty happy with the click through. Ads really aren't doing anything but I leave them because they do no harm.</p>
