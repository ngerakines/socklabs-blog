    Perl Module: Net::FeedBurner
---

I've built a lightweight module to interact with the FeedBurner API. It is open source and now available on CPAN. I don't think that I will create a project blog for it but check the site tags net-feedburner for updates and news.

After a little cleaning and polishing, I've posted it to CPAN. You should be able to find it here: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Net-FeedBurner">http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Net-FeedBurner</a> within 12-24 hours.
