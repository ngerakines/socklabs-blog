    WWW::Search::Feedster 0.02

Update your local perl modules because <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/WWW-Search-Feedster/">WWW::Search::Feedster</a> has been updated. Now in version 0.02 is the ability to have sub searches and a bit more control over what you do with your search. While it is still quite basic, this gives developers a bit more flexibility.
