My name is Nick Gerakines and this is my blog. I'm a native new-orleanian turned californian and have lived on the west coast since mid 2001. I love to program, write and spend time with my family. One of my recent works is "[Facebook Application Development](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470246669/socklabs-20)" (John Wiley & Sons, Inc, published 2008).

I'm pretty active on the usual social facets including [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/snipersock/), [twitter](http://twitter.com/ngerakines), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/Nick_Gerakines/500025891), [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/sock) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ngerakines). I prefer [email](mailto:nick@gerakines.net) over instant messaging but will also respond to Facebook messages.
