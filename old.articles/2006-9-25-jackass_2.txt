    Jackass 2
---

Saturday afternoon Carolyn and I made it over to Noah's New York Bagels and then to see Jackass 2 at the AMC. The whole audience laughed throughout the entire movie. It had its really gross parts, but in whole it was great and worth the cost.

Thats not to say that it didn't have its moments. This is most definitely an <strong>R</strong> film, a strong <strong>R</strong> at that.
