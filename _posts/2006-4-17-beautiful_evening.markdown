    Beautiful evening
---

This afternoon was beautiful. The sky was clear and the temperature was just right. I got home right about 6:00 pm on the 5:15 baby bullet from San Francisco.

This weekend had its twists and turns but we ended up getting a really nice mattress out of it from Mancini's Sleep World in Mountain View. It was delivered today just before I got home and Carolyn had the chance to get a lot done around the house, so by the time I got home we went out to get some food.

This evening consisted of watching <em>Fun with Dick and Jane</em> after eating some good <em>In and Out</em>. I really can't begin to describe how much we are both loving every moment of life right now. Having our own place is sooo nice. Mountain View is turning out to be really nice and I've got high hopes.

I've also started getting into a work routine which is also making me sleep more sane nights. Everything is its own little blessing I suppose.

More another time, I've got a lot to write about but have been way to busy lately to do it. We've also been internet-less for the past few days; DSL isn't going to be connected until the 20th.
