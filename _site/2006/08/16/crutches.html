		 	<p>I absolutely hate the feeling of needing help with day to day activities. Yesterday I left work early to go to the emergency room because of a really bad knee injury. It started last friday at work when I got up to my desk and while I was walking over to Garth's desk ( a whole 5 feet away ) I must of stepped wrong and my knee started hurting.</p>

<p>Since then its been getting worse. Sunday night it was hurting pretty bad. I woke up Monday as if nothing was wrong and when I was walking to the train station I could walk normally and it didn't hurt at all. Reality caught up very quickly because when I took a step out with my right leg I felt a very distinct 'pop' and my knee buckled and came out from under me. Subsequently I fell over and called Carolyn to let her know what happened. I was thinking about going to the ER then but convinced myself that a wrap and ice pack would do some good and decided to just go to work.</p>

<p>Over the course of the day it didn't get any better and I really need to be seen by a doctor. I left early after the 2pm meeting. Carolyn picked me up at the train station in Mountain View and we went strait to the ER.</p>

<p>Now I'm sitting at home in the rocker with my leg propped up with an ACE bandage on it. I have determined that I really don't like crutches, but right now I can't really walk.</p>

<p>This morning was especially painfull when I woke up in agony. There was a really tight fist-sized rock in my right leg just below the knee. It hurt to the point of tears. Carolyn rubbed it out and said it was just a really really bad cramp although I have never had one that bad before.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I have another doctor appointment to investigate it more and to see if I need surgery or not. I'm really not looking forward to it</p>
