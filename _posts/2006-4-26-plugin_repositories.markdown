    Plugin Repositories
---

At SixApart we've started creating public repositories for open source projects. Since the majority of our products and services are open source it only makes sense that we do this. But we want to do more than just give rock solid code back to the community, we want to <em>support</em> it. That means that through http://code.sixapart.com/ we provide repositories, webspace and bandwidth to help your project grow.

Since then I've put numerous projects into revision control. All of the perl modules that I actively develop as well as the movable type plugins and the Atom API client are all hosted through this free service.

For more information about the projects of mine that are hosted with http://code.sixapart.com/ check out the individual project blogs.
