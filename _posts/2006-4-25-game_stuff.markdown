I've been playing NeverWinter Nights lately and love it. I've just gotten about half-way through chapter 2 in the game and the plot is getting thick. The developers and designers did an excellent job at character and plot development.

Its taken me a while because I like to go through the entire game and absorb all of the details. Taking the time to do all of the side quests and go to all of the small and out of the way zones and areas to really get into the game.

I've update the <a href="http://nwn.socklabs.com/wiki">wiki</a> with my latest notes and comments, check it out.

Interestingly enough, the only time that I get to really play the game is on the train to and from work. I would much rather spend time with Carolyn than play, so when I'm at home my computer is usually off and in my bag.
