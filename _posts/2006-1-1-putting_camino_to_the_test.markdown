    Putting Camino to the test
---

I don't know how I missed it before, but I recently just discovered <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, a web browser for OS X that used the firefox engine.

Since switching to mac products I've still had that newbie `which app do I use` cloud around me. I've found some that I really like and some that I really don't like. I really love how integrated Mail, iCal, Safari and so forth are tied into each other in some neat ways. What I also like is the power of Firefox and Adium. To me, Camino represents a comfortable settlement to mix Safari and Firefox.

I've set it as the default web browser and will give it a week or so. I'll post more then.
