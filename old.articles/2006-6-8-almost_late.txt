    Almost late

I've really got to do something about my alarm, it just isn't doing its job. I thought I had more time to get to the caltrain station but instead found the train passing me as I was walking toward it. Miraculously the train hadn't left yet and I found a seat pretty quickly. Day is starting off good.
