		 	<p>Both yesterday and today have involved a good bit of surfing. I hit up some of the southern beaches and practiced. I can stand every now and then but it isn't consistant and I don't actually consider myself a real 'surfer' yet. I did get a new board over the weekend and really love it. It's an 8'6" long board with this wood look to it. I've got a few compliments on it already. It has a great float to it and I love how it feels in the water. I figure its something that I can start off with and yet use as I get better. I'm also figuring out the huge lack of upper body strength that I need but don't have. Looks like I'll be hitting up the gym for that.</p>

<p>I also saw the movie [SockWiki:Sin City], which was very good. It had an ample amount of gore and violence but the plot and cinimatics were great! I had heard a good bit of positive attention from friends and other people, so I went in with high hopes. The priviews had trailers for the <em>Hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy</em> which looks bloody great, and <em>Star Wars: Episode 3</em> which I'd like to boycott but will probly see anyway. They were already selling tickets for it already. That struck me as funny.</p>

<p>At work things are going ok. My contract with [SockWiki:Oversee] is coming to an end soon but it looks very good in regard to me staying. I think that even if I don't stay in my current department I'll definately be with the company one way or another. I've had alot of positive communication in the past few days, which has raised my hopes and thoughts about it all.</p>

<p>All in all, life is good. Chelsea got a new hamster while I was over for the weekend. She named her [SockWiki:Kokonut]. I've also been posting alot of pictures from my phone lately. Don't know how long it will last but its definately alot of fun. I should probly set some sort of filter to not display posts on the front page. Either way I like it. My site has been getting a good bit of extra traffic lately too. For whatever reason the search phrase that brings in the most is <em>old naked women</em>. God have mercy.</p>

<p>I heard from one of the flatmates tonight and said that the house is ok. It was fumigated recently because of termites so all of us have been away. Its a shame to say that the place I'm in has just been one thing after another. Hopefully this will be the last major event for a while.</p>

<p>Future plans look good, I'll be keeping busy. This upcoming Tuesday I will be giving a return and then around [SockWiki:May 8]th I'll receive my 3rd degree. On [SockWiki:April 24]th, [SockWiki:Chelsea] and I will be going to the Sarah Mclochling concert. I will probly go surfing next weekend too. Aside from that nothing else major or big. At work we should have some really cool things coming up that I'm pretty excited about.</p>

<p>I also made some updates to the [SockWiki:Site Wiki] and site plugin system.</p>
