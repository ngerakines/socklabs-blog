    Another Friday

Not much going on tonight, just got back from safeway. I had to get some milk because I have been drinking enough vodka to burn off some of my taste buds and I figure it'd be a good idea to start watering it down with cow juice kaluwa. Yeah, I spelled that wrong but I don't care.

Work was good. Day was good. Shame it isn't over yet.
