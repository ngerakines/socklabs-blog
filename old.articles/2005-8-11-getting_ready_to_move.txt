    Getting ready to move
---

I've officially accepted a job offer with a company based out of San Francisco and I'm preparing for the big move. I wouldn't say that its anything like to another state or country, however, it is a huge lifestyle change to say the least. If anyone lives in the SF bay area and wants to help a new guy out, contact me. I'd appreciate it.
