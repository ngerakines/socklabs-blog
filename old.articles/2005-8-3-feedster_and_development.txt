    Feedster and development
---

I'm testing some different ways of doing things in and around the site. A good bit of server configuration and even some cosmetic stuff, like ads. We'll see how they all pan out in the next month. I figure a good 30 days is well enough trial time to see if it works better than before. If not, a simple revert won't kill me.

I joined <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> yesterday after checking out the services. Its kinda like Google for rss. They've got some very cool things going for them and nice service they offer. Not too long after, I found the API documentation and had some ideas on 3rd party applications. Since I got into work pretty early this morning and had some time on my hands, I rolled out <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/">WWW::Search::Feedster</a>. I'll be letting the dev team over at Feedster about it and also give a few ideas that I had. I think they seriously need to work on the API and consider a stronger xmlrpc interface. Depending on how they go, I'll post the dialog that we have.

I'd like to give a small thanks to Scott about the quick response about it all. Also make note that the modules were approved and its now live on CPAN.
