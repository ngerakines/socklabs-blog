    Midday blogging

Started the day off with some coffee. Carolyn was working this morning and I stopped in to say hi. Met up with Sean and <a href="http://www.hannarifkin.com/">Hanna</a> and hung out for a while. Hanna was working on a lesson plan and I was working an MT plugin. It looks like she has a show coming up as well.

Its been raining off and on all day. We went out after she got off of work to the book store and I picked up <em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal Stephenson. I've had my eye on it for a while and finally had the chance to pick it up. 

After that we made it back to muddys to read and warm up. We also decided to grab sushi from <em>Sushi Miyabi</em> accross the street. I'm pretty caffeinated so I think I'm going to keep hacking at that plugin. Also means I'll try to plow through another few episodes of ER. Only time will show how productive tonight will be.
