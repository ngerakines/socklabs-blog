    Saying goodbye to Brent
---

Brent told me last in night, when I got home from work, that he's headed back to New Orleans and he has a flight out of San Francisco at 5:00 pm today. I was a bit caught off guard and surpised that he's leaving so quickly and furthermore I really don't think its a good idea.

Part of his argument is that its cheaper for him to live in Houston or New Orleans than it is out here. I don't disagree with that at all. I just think its sad that he's leaving.

I'm going to get him to the airport and set him off on his path and then head to work. I'll be sure to get plenty of pictures along the way.
