Facebook, meet spam

I had a feeling that it wouldn't be long before the spam rings started to tap into Facebook. This morning I found a spam comment on the I Play WoW wall about world of warcraft power servers, blah blah blah. I won't link to the name or profile of the spammer, but it is still there if you want to take a look.
