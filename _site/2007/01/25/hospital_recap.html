		 	<p>Last night a Carolyn and I were on the couch snugging while American Idol was on. All of a sudden I told her to move a bit because my back started to her. She moved forward and then it <i>really</i> started to hurt and I proceeded to lie on the floor.</p>

<p>I was on the living room floor for approx 45 mins with a really strong pulsating pain in my mid back. I then tried moving over to the couch to sit up but that was a complete failure and was worse than the floor. After 10 minutes of trying to get comfortable I foolishly decided to try to walk back to the bedroom and thats when it really got bad.</p>

<p>About 2 hours had gone by since it first happened I was laying on the floor in the bedroom. I made the decision to go to the Hospital but it was pretty obvious given how hard it was for me to move that Carolyn and I could do it on our own. It started getting much worse and Carolyn called 911. About 5 mins later an ambulance was here and I was on my way.</p>

<p>The took me to El Camino and gave me a pretty strong dose of delautin and I conked out pretty quickly. They discharged me with a few prescriptions and told me that I was under bedrest until Monday.</p>

<p>It was pushing on 5:30 by the time we got home and went to sleep. I woke up a few times this morning but slept until 3:15. I'm sitting up (which is a big step) and the drugs have really kicked in. I'm trying to get some work done, but its kind of hard to focus.</p>
