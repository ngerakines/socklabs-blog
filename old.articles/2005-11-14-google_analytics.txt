    Google Analytics
---

Back in March of 2005 Google aquired Urchin, a web statistics and analytics firm. Urchin, the product, was fairly simple to use and customize and I've used it on on a few different sites before.

Recently, Google has announced a product called <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>. This seems to be an implementation of the recently acquired urchin webstats. It provides some basic statistical information about a given page or website and can let users create custom reports and get coverage information. It also looks to have some tie-ins to the adsense network. Perhaps another free tool for spammers?

Don't give them too much credit though, this system is neither new or special, it just has a Google brand logo on it. Urchin is one of the many products out there that do this, not to mention several of the free and open source applications like <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">awstats</a> or <a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">webalizer</a>.
