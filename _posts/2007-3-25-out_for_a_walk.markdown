    Out for a walk
---

Carolyn and I are about to head out to Shoreline for a nice long walk. Its a bit overcast but I think it'll turn out out.

Yesterday we did a lot of running around. Lunch a Noah's followed by a good bit of shopping at Target and a brief trip to babies-r-us. Later in the evening we did a partial run of Blackrock Depths which subsequently became my new favorite instance. BRD is the new DM.

I also posted a bunch of stuff to Flickr.
