		 	<p>Volume 06 of Make magazine is on the table and I'm looking forward to some reading before bed after today. Front cover says 'Robots!' and I can only imagine that it will fill me with inspiration that Carolyn will dread.</p>

<p>We just got home from seeing the movie '<em>RV</em>' with Robin Williams. I'd say it was one step above Mission Impossible which makes it the 3rd best movie I've seen this year. What feels a bit sad is that the first and second are '<em>V for Vendetta</em>' and '<em>She's the man</em>'.</p>

<p><strong>Hollywood</strong>: What is going on!? The past few years have really been a drag. All these law suits and bad publicity, and now lack of ideas? I mean you really did great with movies like LOTR and Serenity, but has the hat of ideas really started to empty on you? Pick up the slack, or the numbers are <em>Only Going To Get Worse</em>.</p>

<p>The original idea was that we were going to take a break from computing and play Laser Tag, but when we arrived we were told that the place was rented out for the night for a private party. Eh <em>shrugs</em>.</p>

<p>This morning I got a message from <a href="http://www.jamesgross.com/">James</a> telling me about the <a href="http://www.meetro.com/">Meetro</a> <a href="http://www.meetro.com/bbq/">BBQ</a> so Carolyn and I decided to go check it out. We left around 1:10-ish because I thought it was at 1:30 but quickly found out after getting lost and checking directions at the Palo Alto Apple store that it was at 3:00 so we had some time to kill.</p>

<p>Foolishly I took the chance before me to get a hair cut. Stupid stupid decision. I saw a barber shop on University close to the Borders that seemed nice and I went in. I told the guy to give me a trim but by the time he was done with me I almost had a buzz cut. I don't like my haircut, I think he did a crummy job. After he was paid we left and went over to Longs to pick up some pomade and salvage what I could.</p>

<p>By then the party was starting and we headed over. We were the first ones there and the rest of the afternoon went without a hitch. Met and talked to lots of cool people, had some good food and all in all had a good time.</p>

<p>All thats left for me to do tonight is some last might hacking on <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/fence/">Fence</a> and a shower.</p>
