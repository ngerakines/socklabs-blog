title: 2008 in Review & 2009 Goals
---

2008 was a great year of activity and excitement. I've got the sneaking suspicion that 2009 is going to be no less busy.

 * Finished and published my first book!
 * Spoke at CUFP and met a lot of really smart people.
 * Gave several tech-talks and presentations.
 * Learned how to develop apps for the iPhone.
 * Migrated I Play WoW from a Perl app to an Erlang app.
 * Learned about CouchDB.
 * Learned Git.
 * Accepted a lead position at EA.

This is what I'd like to accomplish in 2009.

 * Finish my second book.
 * Do more tech-talks and presentations.
 * Have a 100 day streak of open source commits on GitHub.
 * Write more technical articles and entries.
 * Learn Python.
 * Hit level 80 with Korale and get into tier 9.
 * Grow I Play WoW to 75,000 monthly active users.
