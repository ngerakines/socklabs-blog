    Ipod Condom
---

I forgot to mention that I got a protective encasing for my ipod nano not too long ago. Its a green gel that fits right over it and works fairly well. My only gripe is that it doesn't protect the screen which defeats the purpose of it. At work the other day Scott walked by and noticed, thus we call it a condom.
