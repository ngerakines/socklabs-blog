    An Extra long weekend

Between the dentist episode and going to Santa Cruz, I've got soo much to ramble on about.

Thursday and Friday were disastrous. What was going to be a simple dentist appointment turned into a catastrophe. I spent Thursday and Friday in an endodondist chair and a sore jaw. More on that later as it unfolds.

Friday afternoon Carolyn and I went down to Santa Cruz with her mom and sister. The drive down 17 was really nice and I enjoyed it. Its not soo often that I get to 'just drive' like that. We made it to the hotel, which was right on the beach I might add, with plenty of time to head out to the boardwalk.

We spent the better part of the afternoon on rides and playing games. It was a lot of fun. We also had time to squeeze in dinner and a nap which gave me the chance to send some pictures to flickr.

Later that evening Carolyn, Melissa and I went to the arcade and ended up playing this quiz game over and over again. It was pretty fun. We made it back after winning a ton of tickets and getting Carolyn a blue bear.

I had a real hard time sleeping that night. My back didn't agree with the bed at all. When morning rolled around we got breakfast and met up with her mom and sister and watched the last of the England vs Portugal soccer match.

We went on a some rides and did a lot of walking. Carolyn ended up getting <em><strong>really bad</strong></em> sunburn. Most of mine was gone by Sunday morning. I also started to feel kinda sick by 3:00 pm -ish. Not really sure what it was exactly but it wasn't fun.

We left Santa Cruz around 4:30 - 5:00 and made good time. There wasn't any traffic which kind of surprised us. We spent that night relaxing and dealing with burns, it was nice to be back.
