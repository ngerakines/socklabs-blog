    Subscribing to Pandora
---

I made the decision tonight to subscribe to the service provided on <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora.com</a>. I first heard about Pandora a few months ago and gave it a try. I absolutely loved it. I'm getting to the point where I really do want to find what is different out there. I think its a great discovery service and really help you find other artists, songs and even genres that you may like. It also has quick links to the artists and albums on iTunes and Amazon, so if you find an artist or song that you listen to often you can easily buy it.

I'm very satisfied and I'm looking forward to a much more diverse audio library.
