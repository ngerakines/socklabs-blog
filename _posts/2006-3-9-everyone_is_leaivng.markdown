<strike>I bunch of my friends are headed over to <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> and I'm jealous.</strike> Oh wait, no I'm not. Ignore that.

So the socklabs.com home page has been given a better template. I figure it was time to move on from the trusty ole blue robot design. I picked the current one because it validates as strict xhtml, has a very clean and minimalist interface and looks somewhat similar to the old skin. Still using <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">planetplanet</a> as the aggregator but I'm looking at alternatives. <a href="http://plagger.org/trac">Plagger</a> looks like it could do the trick. We'll see how busy I am over the next few weeks.

Carolyn and I found a place in Mountain View that we both really like and applied for. We'll find out real soon how it turns out but we are optimistic. Moving out of the city is kind of a big deal to me, but it'll work out I think.

Pizza from lunch is all gone now, back to work.
