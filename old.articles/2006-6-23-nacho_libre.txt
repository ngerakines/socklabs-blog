I got tickets to <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0457510/">Nacho Libre</a> with hopes that, like many of Jack Black's other movies, I would walk out with a smile and possibly still laughing to myself. Instead, I left feeling like I had completely and utterly wasted 2 hours of my life.

In regard to the story, the movie wasn't bad. A bit eclectic and off balance, but still something that could be interesting. It had an interesting range of characters with different and dynamic personalities. The acting wasn't bad as well. I make a clear distinction between the acting and the direction. I think that all of the actors did a good job.

The direction sucked. The direction made the plot feel choppy and uneven. Also the random and chaotic insertion of elements, like the watermelon??, didn't fit in and only made the movie feel unprofessional.

The visuals were ok at best. I've got nothing to say, positive or negative, about them except that they didn't make the movie any better or worse.
