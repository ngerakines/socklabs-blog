Carolyn says that I'm a bit of a grouch during the christmas season. I don't think its entirely true, but I won't argue it either. Its technically christmas eve but my family is celebrating it all a few hours early because we are headed into New Orleans on christmas day to be with the rest of the family.

Ben and Charlie got some pretty cool things. Charlie got a bearded dragon and the cage to go along with it. Mom got her usual kitchen items and some dish towels. Both of the boys got TVs of their own.

And as always, we kept up the family tradition of eating fried cherios.

Christmas this year wasn't bad. I'm glad that I've had the chance to spend it with family and I'm especially glad that Carolyn had the chance to come down as well.
