I'm organizing an Erlounge event hosted at Yahoo's Sunnyvale, CA campus. This event is for Erlang developers, users and anyone interested in what is going on in the field. The event is on Thursday, August 21st from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. Please refer to the [Upcoming.org event page](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/977428/) or the original [post to the mailing list](http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2008-August/037119.html) for more information.
