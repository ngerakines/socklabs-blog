I'm proud to say that the wrsd project is now available on Google Code under the GPL. As per the project page

> wrsd is a World of Warcraft realm monitoring daemon that serves individual realm status information.

Although the project seriously lacks documentation, there is a quick start guide and the code is relatively easy to follow. Well, I think is at least. If you are interested in joining the project let me know. The roadmap includes on adding support for european and asian realms and providing a JSON interface.
