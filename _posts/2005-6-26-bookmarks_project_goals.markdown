    Bookmarks project goals
---

So I've been playing with this project <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/">bookmarks</a> alot lately. Essentially what I'm trying to do is create a better <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a> using raw mod_perl and xml/xsl transformation. So far I'm very satisfied with the entire project. Its coming along quite well but I know there is alot to do still.

The xml/xsl transformation layer is working wonderfully. I've also gotten pretty good at converting html to strict xhtml and then to xsl for display. There are some things here and there that I still am not entirely sure about but hey, thats ok. Its all a learning process anyway.

Right now a visitors can create accounts and add bookmarks with tags. What the site lacks is the ability to edit bookmarks and tags. Once you put a url in you are kinda stuck as to what you can do with it. Thats pretty high on the todo list. Another thing I would like to do is to list all bookmarks that share tags. Either this can be a custom filter or something different alltogether. That way I could say that I want to view all bookmarks that share myspace and friends and then, in theory, get all of the urls for my friends myspace accounts.

I've also been working on a QT application called qtbookmarks. Its basically a front end for the website written in c++ that uses the xml api of the website. Once that project is stable and working I also want to create a firefox plugin as well. There are alot of ways to really use 3rd party apps for the better.

Last but not least I want to enable searching. Right now it doesn't really exist but what I'd like to do is enable searching of tags, descriptions and urls.
