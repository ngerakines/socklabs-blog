This weekend is ending on a very relaxing note. Although its late, we've got blueberry muffins cooling off and we are getting ready for bed. There was a change from our routine this afternoon as we made it to the gym after picking up some running shoes. It was really nice.

Today went by smoothly. Earlier in the day we made a trip to babies-r-us to do some more planning and scoping for when Vanessa arrives. So far so good, but there is always something at the last minute that you forget to think about. More on this over on the <a href="/dadhood">dadhood</a> blog.

On saturday I got a significant amount of <a href="http://fence.typepad.com/">Fence</a> hacking under my belt. More on the <a href="http://fence.typepad.com/">Fence project blog</a>.

On Friday night we saw 'Pirates of the Caribbean' with one of her friends and her friend's mom. We had a lot of fun. Carolyn and her friend went off to have dinner before the movie, but Tulin and I had a few beers and caught up with them a bit later. We had a good time. I thought the movie was good although I think Tiffany makes a few interesting points in <a href="http://tiffany.vox.com/library/post/piratesshmirates.html">her review of the movie</a>.

Oh and on a similar note, the movie 'Nightwatch' came in the mail via NetFlix. I didn't watch more than 20 minutes, it was crap.
