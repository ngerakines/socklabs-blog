    Erlang is Delicious, CUFP slides
---

Here are the slides from my CUFP 2008 presentation "Developing Erlang at Yahoo". The slides can be [viewed online](http://blog.socklabs.com/cufp2008.html) and there is a [PDF available](http://blog.socklabs.com/cufp2008.pdf).

I'm very glad that I went to the [ICFP](http://www.icfpconference.org/)/[CUFP](http://cufp.galois.com/) 2008. I was pleasantly surprised at how many folks in the SF bay area are getting into Erlang and other functional programming languages. I also had the chance to meet some of the other larger players in the Erlang realm in North America.

Victoria was beautiful and I'd love to go back some time. The trip really sparked my interest in going to Canada again.
