    I have an Iphone
---

During lunch I stopped at the Valley Fair Apple Store and got an iPhone. The line went pretty quick and I got one of the last 4 gig models. It definitely has a certain wow-appeal that most other phones aren't capable of radiating.

The ui is amazing. I know there have been plenty of people ranting and raving about how awesome it is, but its my turn. I've never used a handheld that is so intuitive. Its scary-easy to create and send message either by email or sms. The keyboard is slick and type-forward is very impressive. I haven't done a lot of web browsing but what I've seen so far is really nice. Navigating sites is a lot easier than I thought it would be.

I was a little worried about what Carolyn would think about me having one and her not. I did a good bit of pacing and thinking about what to say and do but when I walked in the door I was surprised. She had a big smile on her face and lifter hers up. Apparently she got one today as well and was really worried about how I would feel about not having one. We laughed about it a little and as Nick put it "You both picked your mates well."
