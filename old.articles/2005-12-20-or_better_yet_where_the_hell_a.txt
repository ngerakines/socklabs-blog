    Or better yet, where the hell am I?

We are making a quick stop at <i>the flying J</i>, a truck stop somewhere near Gulfport, MS. We are on our way to Panama City, FL to meet with the parents and to spend a few days with them before we all head back to Mandeville, LA to have christmas with the rest of the family. Its been a fun time in the city, but I'm finding a certain comfort on the road.

More later.
