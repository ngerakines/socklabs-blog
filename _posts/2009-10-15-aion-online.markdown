title: Aion Online
---

I've been getting a lot of fun out of Aion Online lately. I've got a level [18 Eleyos Cleric](http://na.aiononline.com/characters/Fregion/Korale) on Fregion. The game graphics are amazing and really blow the others out of the water. I think it's built on the CryEngine engine.

I'm not sure what it is exactly that I like about Aion though. It could be simply that it's an MMORPG that isn't WoW. The lore is also pretty neat, although way underdeveloped when compared to WoW. It'd be cool to make an "I Play Aion" Facebook application but I'm not really sure that I have the time. If I did, I'd probably want to experiment writing it in Django.
