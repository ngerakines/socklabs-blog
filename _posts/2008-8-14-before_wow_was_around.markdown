    Before WoW was around

There's been a lot of talk lately about Erlang's potential in the gaming industry and rightfully so. In a spout of nostalgia I hopped onto [AberPhoenix](http://phoenix.terrabox.com/), a mud that spent many many hours of my life on. In fact, I can say with pride that it was [AberPhoenix](http://phoenix.terrabox.com/) that sparked my interest in programming. Sifting through code, trying to understand what did what and how along with creating quests is how I started programming in the first place. My entire life, altered through this game.

When I logged on there was only one other player on, Dubbug, who was AFK. I did a `laston` for a few of my old friends and was not surprised to see that there have been, literally, years since they've logged on. I used to play a lot and it was the type of place where everyone knew everyone else. The userbase was pretty active and there were regular events on weekdays and weekends.

I played a lot and also coded quite a bit. I've put in a few patches into pdirt, based on the Aber codebase, and also contributed a number of zones. My name, Sock, is somewhere in that huge list of `credits` for a few of the quests, zones, random content and a few bug fixes.

All of this got me thinking about what it was like playing. MUDs are so foreign to gamers today. Even though the RPG concept is still mostly the same, the things you have to do in game are dramatically different. Instead of having a graphical interface that you use to explore the world in 3d, you have text. Lots and lots of text.

Entire worlds are described for you to consume and imagine. You actually have to read, consume and understand to play the game. To know that there is a door you have to `look` to see the room's descriptive text, `ex door` to examine the door (assuming there is a hint that a door exists) and then perform some sort of command to interact with it like `open door` or `break door`.

Its my belief that the players and contributers are much more committed to these games because of the level of involvement. New to the game it would take weeks and months to get to a high level. For players interested in end-game content there is usually a remort system for going between mortal and immortal phases that.

The thing that I think MUDs didn't do was satisfy group goals. In the World of Warcraft you have guilds and parties where a bunch of players band together for a common goal. MUDs, in general, are very single-player task oriented. I think WoW really took off because of that.

What I really love most about MUDs is the fact that you usually have an impact on the worlds you play in. The distance between players and content creators is usually really small so the feedback loop of what works and doesn't work is tight. Most MUDs are usually open to user-created content for zones, quests and generic content too.

**MUDs are the ultimate in open source, user generated content driven gaming.**

If you've never played on a MUD then you should try it, just to see what its like. The vast majority of them are free and it doesn't take much time to go through the introductory areas and information. Of course I think you should check out AberPhoenix, but there are [plenty of other MUDs](http://www.mudconnect.com/) with different styles and themes.
