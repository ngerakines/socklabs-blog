<blockquote>The finest blade stays in the scabbard.</blockquote>

It recent years I've taken to japanese sword art, mainly Iaido. Now that things have stabilized a bit in my life I've found a <a href="http://www.iaido.org/">dojo in San Francisco</a> that I've joined and am actively taking lessons in. I guess it all started a while ago when Brent got into european sword art and I became interested in a japanese style.
