    My first day in San Francisco
---

I really miss Los Angeles. I should rephrase that, I miss Amanda, Eric, Coco, Corey, Tyeson, Susan and Chelsea. The day started off kinda rough as I was driving to the airport and on the radio there was a cover about the hurricane and its devistating effect on New Orleans. I was pretty worried to be honest. I didn't actually get ahold of any of them until I was about to board my flight.

The actual flight was pretty boring. Sat next to a lady that was flying up to start a job as an art teacher at Berkeley. I've actually got a pretty good system when it comes to the Burbank to Oakland trip that I've been making once every two weeks. I jumped on the train to downtown SF and made it to work.

As soon as I walked into the office they pulled me right into a telephone conference, and that was a good example of how the day went. Meetings and phone calls for pretty much most of it. I like it, I like it alot actually. I really like this type of fast paced enviroment. It keeps me on my toes.

One of the many perks of the day was getting my new powerbook. Its a really nice 15" thats been souped up. I love my machine. I havn't completely tweaked it out quite yet but I'm getting there. I'm still getting used to not having an insert key to be honest.

And although I may rave about how great the city of San Francisco is, I really do miss my friends.

My goal is to take at least 5 pictures a day for a week and I'll be posting them regularly. We'll see how they come out. I'll post more as it comes.
