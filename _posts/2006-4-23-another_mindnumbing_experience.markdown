    Another mind-numbing experience at the ER
---

I don't like hospitals or doctors. For me at least. I don't have any problem whatsoever taking someone else or helping as long as its not me. Take this past friday as an example.

For a while I've had a random nerve pinch problem near my heart. I've been to the ER 3 separate times and each time they've run different tests with the same outcome and prescription: Nothing is wrong, stretch more and take some vicodin. Great. Thanks. Big help.

So for the past few days its been really hurting and I told Carolyn on Friday morning that if it hurt any more we would go to the ER because she was worried about me. While I was at work later that day it really started to hurt and I called to tell her. She had to drop her plans with a friend who was in town but she did come by the office to pick me up.

We went to Stanford Medical Center ER and checked in right about 4:50 pm. After a <em><strong>4 hour wait</strong></em> I was admitted and they took a chest x-ray and an EKG to send me off with a prescription and no real answer as to what is going on.

Great. Once again the american healthcare system has proven its worth to me.

By the time we left both Carolyn and I were real pissy. Carolyn was frustrated with me for various reasons, all my fault and I admit as legitimate. I was pissed because [a] I HATE doctor visits for myself [b] I HATE emergency rooms more [c] I waited 4 hours to get the exact same result as last time. In all truth and honesty it feels like going was a waste of time. For Carolyn's sake it did rule out a lot of possible things and I did get a real prescription for the pain. She was the one who had to drop plans with an old friend for it and for that I truly am sorry.
