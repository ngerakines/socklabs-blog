Carolyn and I had a few hours to get ready before we headed over to the hospital. Most of the time was spent cleaning and getting things ready at home, but we did leave the house with enough time to get some sushi at Miyabi Sushi near my old watering hole at church and market street in San Francisco.

The drive up to the city was nice, the traffic wasn't bad. We made good time and actually got to the sushi place before it opened so we hung out at muddy waters across the street.

Dinner was good and we ended up getting to the hospital early. No internet connection in the room but I have great cell phone reception.
