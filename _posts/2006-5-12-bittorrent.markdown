I was really getting excited about creating a perl module along the lines of Net::BitTorrent::Tracker and even got into writing a good bit of it then found the awesome project <a href="http://www.crackerjack.net/mod_bt/">mod_bt</a> and game over.

mod_bt is an entire bit torrent tracker written as an apache 2.0 module in c. Even better, it is being actively developed.

Check it out, get one started and if its any good let me know.
