    Standing with giants

This weekend Carolyn and I took a refreshing and scenic trip up to see the coastal redwoods in the 'Avenue of Giants'.

I've always loved roadtrips and driving. Going through the mountains and forests was awe inspiring and refreshing in many ways. <a href="http://carolyn.socklabs.com/">Carolyn</a> and I had a great time.

I've got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock/sets/1561533/">lots of pictures</a> and will post more about it later. Now, I need to get some sleep. I'm looking at a big week ahead of me.
