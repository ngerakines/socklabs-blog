    Lost

The episode of Lost that was on last night was really good. Blog worthy even. Looking back at the last 3 or so episodes and comparing them to the first, let say, 5 episodes of this season, its amazing how much stuff is going on right now. People are defecting to opposite sides, there are murders and more mysteries are coming into plain sight as the focus of the show starts to shift toward <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/The_Others">the others</a>.

I think the biggest mystery right now is the ghost known as <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Jacob">Jacob</a>. I can't wait for next week.
