    On our way home from Las Vegas
---

So we are waiting in the airport to take a flight back to Mountain View. Its been a long morning full of packing and rushing to get ready. Carolyn is a bit leery about going back home because the apartment isn't sparkling clean, but that isn't uncalled for or unrealistic. I'm really excited about getting back home, posting some of the pictures we took and playing with Picasso (whom I suspect will be very happy to see us).

Yesterday we saw <i>Beatles Love</i> at the Mirage. The show was amazing and I think it was one of the best performances I've ever seen. Cirque du Soleil performed a masterful show and the soundtrack was inspiring.

Vanessa has been fussy for the majority of the morning and we are both really worried that she is going to fuss on the plane. I don't know if this is going to go so well.
