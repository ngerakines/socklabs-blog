A while ago I had a forum setup for general discussion and support. I had a real hard time with it because of the huge amount of spam I was getting. I've decided to <a href="http://forum.socklabs.com/">give it another go</a> with <a href="http://swik.net/Vanilla">Vanilla</a>. <a href="http://forum.socklabs.com/">Check it out</a> and if you want to you can create an account and get involved.
