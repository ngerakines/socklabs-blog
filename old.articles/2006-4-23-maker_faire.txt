    Maker Faire

Today was the second day of <a href="http://www.makezine.com/faire/">Maker Faire</a> at the San Mateo Fairgrounds. It was a ton of fun and I can't even begin to describe all of the projects and events that were there.

I worked the booth and helped <a href="http://ljkrissy.livejournal.com/">Krissy</a> and Jason. I got to talk about TypePad and LiveJournal and meet a lot of really cool people. I also got a nice take on how many people were already livejournal, typepad or movable type users and how they really liked our product.

We made a small video too. <a href="http://www.socklabs.com/podcasts/videocast-2006-04-23.m4v">videocast-2006-04-23.m4v</a>
