    He finally ate!
---

The day carried through like byte stream heading toward /dev/null. Oliver has been much more playfull and has been eating non stop to make up for the fast he's been on. I cleaned up today, mostly my area and the cat's stuff. Also did some laundry. I have a habbit of cleaning when i'm in a bad mood. I'm also very quiet and reclusive; more so than normal. I did some work on my site. Mostly with allow/deny rules for questor. Its coming along pretty good. I'll make posts as soon as i'm confortable with releasing code. I really like how the timing and ip rules are coming along. regex is very cool. I'll also be tweaking out the site's skin again. I've been playing with this one for a bit now and found some flaws i'm not to fond of. I'll save the old version and the new version and submit them both to <a href='http://www.plogworld.org'>plogworld.org</a>. I've also been in contact with the site's creator and he's going to add my link up there in the list of examples. Been thinking of diff color schemes too. Maybe something with a splash of color in it to soften the glow a bit.

Also been playing warcraft 3 alot lately. Found that a cousin of mine is big into it and we'll get together and play online some day. This afternoon i've had a splitting head-ache from not having any coffee lately. I got some coffee and came back then finished the book <i>Storm Rising</i>. I started the next, <i>Storm Breaking</i> and the first couple pages seem good. After this one i want to read <i>Catch a thief</i>. It looks interesting. Tonight my todo list is occupied mostly by computer stuff. I got ben setup to read my media library. He's happy because now he can listen to all of the music i have. I've forbidden any sort of p2p client usage on this network by those who don't know how to do it securely. I've played with <a href='http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/'>bit torrent</a> alot lately. Its very fun.

My Aunt Donna dropped by for a bit to see Oliver and chat with my mom. That was fun. After that there was a pretty heated debate over something h. clinton said about ghandi. More rabble on the <i>Liberals vs. Conservatives</i> debate. Nothing that phased me too badly. ATM i'm trading pictures with a friend of mine back east. I'll post some code poetry and snippets later.
