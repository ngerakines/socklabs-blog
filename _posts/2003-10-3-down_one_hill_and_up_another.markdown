Today started off on a bad note. Jacob woke me up and we had a talk about the bills situation. I'm not even going to get into that right now, but its not good. I woke up around noon and got dressed and went to vvc. The plan for today was for me to meet Fallen at the end of her speech class at 145p and then walk her to her next class and in the mean time get her number and continue on. But no, instead of that idea the phrase 'crash and burn' comes to mind. It botched as I missed her after speech and ran to the science wing to find her eating with her friend, forgot her name, and I sat with them and tried chatting them up. Those two are sure quiet when I come around, its unsettling. All in all that effort was not a complete waste but more like set back until monday after she considers giving me her number. Women, Sheesh.

Oh no though, my trouble with women doesn't end there. Not by a long shot. After that i head back to the commons and plop a spot and relax. It was around 2p when that was over so I had a bit of time to kill. After fending some very creepy guys off of Lindsey while doing my french homework she took off and it looks like Woody and her are supposed to talk tonight. Thats very good, that'll give her a chance to get things off her chest and maybe have some closure in the relationship. She needs closure. Anywho, Erin, a girl from french class, came up to me and we ended up talking for the better part of 2 hours. She is someone I would of never otherwise given even a chance of conversation but I'm glad I did. She's a nice girl and she has personality. A bit of a vandal and weirdo but hey we all have quirks. So yeah that was nice. Today I made new friends and become closer with the ones I'd been making lately.

Tomorrow, aka later today (230a), looks promising. I have a massive test in english class, 160+ questions it looks, so I'm going to wake up early to study for that. Also that girl that I met on tuesday will be at vvc as well. That'll give me a chance to lower my ego a bit more and admit that I lost her number and maybe if she doesn't think I'm a looser I can get it again. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. Oh and after class and all I'm going to be meeting with cory for our french work group. I'm also going to try to start another with the people in my class because we all need more exposure. That'll be really cool. I'm not going to go into how Beverly was acting very strange in class, its not worth it.

Tonight has been productive. Made some cool addition to Questor and its picking up very well. Also downloaded and burned the mandrake 9.1 cds. I'm going to make a jukebox out of it. Also maybe a Tivo but i'd need a nice TV card. We'll see. I'll be sure to post a blog entry on its creation and status. 

Also i want to go on a rant about parents and them complaining about their kids being hyperactive after they give them expresso. Blows my mind. Oh that reminds me some how that i have to bring my old fat pictures with me to math class so some friends will believe that i did weight 210lbs at one point in time. No one does. Go figure. Life is busy but i like it. I'm working 16 hours this week and like 21 next week. I'm very very very happy about my hours. Working my ass off finally paid off.

On my mind lately:
- Questor, how i'm going to work that out
- French class and how i need to study more
- Considering if i should change my box from redhat 9 to mandrake 9.1 or maybe debian
- Fallen and how i can get htat to work out
- What i did wrong with bethany
- If i should keep this fur or not
- This magic tourniment that i signed up for
- English class and this test tomorrow
- Not failing math
- Mom and her stresses about school
- How brent is doing, i havn't been able to get ahold of him
- The song 'She talks to Angels' by Black Crows
- Money, or the lack there of

Its getting late though, its about 230a. I set my alarm for 9a so I can get up do everything I need to be ready for the day and then going to study. I NEED to do good on this english test. I'll do fine on the vocab and similar but its all the info about the essays we read in class that I'm not sure of. We'll see. My weekend outlook is open. I work on friday, an opening shift, but after that I don't work at all until monday, I think. Its very cool to have the better part of the weekend off. Maybe i'll go out or something, that'd be nice. Its been a while since I've had the chance to treat any ladies to a really nice night.

Sunday I'm probably going to goto my mom's house and say hi. She wants to oder new computer parts for the boys and I told her I'd help. She sounds really down last i talked to her. School is probably hitting her hard. She's a compulsive A+ student and its hard to make an A in law school. Hell its hard to make a C. She's a fighter though and I know she'll do the best she can. Whether her best is good enough for her I'll never really know. Havn't talked to any other family in a while. Been real busy. Should email Leslie to see how life is and grandmother too. And dad, might as well through him in the todo list. I've been sending him my markouts lately and i bought him a thermos, he liked it. It was a really nice one, leather and all. I also need to go shopping, basic stuff. Razor, shampoo, etc. The nights have been really nice lately. I love the fall weather, we keep the windows open at night and it is so comfortable. I love it like this. Bah, I'm starting to ramble, a sign of hope-sleepy-talk. I'm going to crash.
