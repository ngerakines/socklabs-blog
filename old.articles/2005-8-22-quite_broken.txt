    Quite broken
---

The server has been quite broken for the past few days. I decided to upgrade apache because of some recent flaws that have been running wild and of course that invovled upgrading the core apache server as well as php and all that mess. Finally taken care of and running `ok`, however its kinda buggy and feels off somehow. I guess that is the price you pay for security.
