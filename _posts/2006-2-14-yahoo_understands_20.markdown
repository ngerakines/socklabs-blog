    Yahoo understands 2.0
---

Yahoo has shown not just general interest, but a constant understand and development of web 2.0. Recently Yahoo started releasing its ui and design patterns to the public. From what it looks, Yahoo is putting a lot of what it is building into its own proprietary systems into the community with a BSD license.

I'm simply amazed. Go yahoo, get down with your bad self.
