I have about 200+ feeds in NetNewsWire that I dig through every 6 hours or so. If you add it all up, it probably amounts to reading 2 books a week. I was reading <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/">Alex Barnett's blog</a> and saw that he was pointing to <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing.com</a>.

Its a pretty cool site that lets you create an online catalog of the books you own. I think you can do the same thing with <a href="http://www.majordojo.com/projects/MTAmazon/">MTAmazon</a>, but for the people who aren't using MovableType this might be the ticket.

Go try it out, look at how it works and then check out <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=ngerakines">my small, but growing, collection</a>.
