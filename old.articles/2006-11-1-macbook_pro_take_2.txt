    MacBook Pro, take 2
---

For my 23rd birthday Carolyn's mom gave me a macbook pro and I can't find the words to describe how surprised I was. It really is a beautiful machine and on top of that, how useful Parallels is.

A few days later Carolyn approached her mom and mentioned that they released a upgraded model. Well, this past Sunday we went over to the Apple store to trade it in but they didn't have any in stock. So now I've got a store credit for it and I'm on a waiting list to hear back from them. Until then I'm on my powerbook (which satisfies all of my needs).
