    Eyes on fire

Tonight ended up being much more eventful than I expected. Sharon and Melissa, the mother and sister in law, came over for dinner and beignets. With them came Peanut's first gifts. Sooner or later I'll get some pictures of the really cute ones (which there are quite a few of).

All of us contributed to dinner and desert and I think we had a lot of fun in the process. They stayed pretty late but we talked and had a good time.

Later in the evening my eyes really started to burn. Since then about every 20-30 minutes they hurt (as in burn) and tear up for a few. If it continues, I might have to see a doctor tomorrow.
