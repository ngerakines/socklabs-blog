    Moblogging
---

With a little bit of effort and a lot of testing, my site is now 'moblog' enabled. This simply means that I can now make blog posts of images or text from my mobile phone. Hopefully I can start adding alot of new and probly random content on a daily basis. Once again, drupal to the rescue.

If you are interested in jumping on the idea, let me know. On request I'll give the email address used to post automatically to the site.
