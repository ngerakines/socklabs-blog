		 	<p>Yesterday was significant. I'm starting to think that women like me or something because they keep hitting on me. I've found the secret i think: Don't be easy. If you are a challenge they they will seriously give there all to try and get you and you have some sort of fucked up worth in their minds. Its all about the challenge. Lindsey and Erin are both pretty obvious that they like me and even Tiffany, from back in the day, was flirting with me. Its very odd. I have to head to work soon but all in all yesterday was really good.</p>

<p>I'll do it a section at a time. In the morning i'd woken up got ready and then headed off to vvc in hopes of finding lois because for whatever reason i'd lost her number. Well I found her and we talked a bit but it seemed weird. Maybe she is a lost cause. We'll see. Supposedly we are going to see a movie today or something but its already 630am and my money hasn't been directly deposited in the bank so I'm a bit worried. Also Lindsey, Antonio, Erin and that bunch is going to the movies on saturday and I'm going with them. Might see kill bill or something. Either way its a chance to get out. Saturday around noon I'm going to have lunch with Chelsea.</p>

<p>English class was fun. We took a very large test. I gotta jet, i'll put more in when i get off.</p>
