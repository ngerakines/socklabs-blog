    Lost (Season 2, Episode 14): One of Them
---

<a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/carolyn/">Carolyn</a> and I watched this episode late on Thursday evening and were hooked. The flashbacks in this episode were focused on bringing out several major events of Sayid's past.

In this episode Danielle takes Sayid into the jungle to one of her traps. He discovers that one of '<em>the others</em>' was caught. He takes the injured man back to camp where Jack and Locke learn of what Sayid has found. Jack tends to his wounds while Locke changes the combination to the lock where the guns where stored. Jack leaves for a moment and comes back to find that Sayid has locked himself and the stranger in the gun storage room and he and Locke begin to fight about it.

Toward the end of the show, Jack and Locke have major conflict where Jack holds Locke back from typing in the code to the machine. Locke is obviously more obsessed than logical and proceeds to open the door to let Jack in. Sayid was in the process of torturing the stranger who he, and the viewers, are convinced that he really is one of the <em>others</em>. Jack being a man of compassion, not sense, takes Sayid away and prevents him from continuing.

The numbers for the count down timer are replaced by a set of very strange looking hieroglyphics and we start to hear the sound of a very large engine starting to turn on. Locke quickly types in 2 keys and everything starts to shut down and go back to normal.

The show closes with Sayid talking to Charlie on the beach saying that he knew he was doing the right thing and that the stranger was an <em>other</em> because he felt no regret or remorse. The scene ends when he asks Charlie if he has forgotten that they took Claire and him away.

This show was real entertainment. It was a really wise choice to starting bringing more interaction with the survivors and the others. Jack had started with his army and it was brought up, but this brings things one step further.

My first thought was that the stranger was one of the others on a reconnaissance mission. It is very out of character for any of the others to get captured or to even not notice that one of there own is missing for two days. I think they were testing the survivors in some way to see what they would do. It just seems to easy that one of the others walked right into a trap and let himself get captured like that.

I'm also a bit peeved that the show doesn't air next week and that we have to wait until March to find out what happens with the captive. Until then.
