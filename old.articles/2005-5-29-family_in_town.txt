This weekend has been real busy so far. I know this post is kinda coming out of nowhere. I havn't posted anything legitamate in a while now. Bear with me, it might be a bit random and chaotic.

My cousins <a href="http://jamie.montelepre.org">Jamie</a> and <a href="http://tiffany.montelepre.org">Tiffany</a> flew in on Saturday and I picked them up from LAX. They are going to be spending a little over 5 weeks in Australia and stopped in California for a few days before they head out. That day we spent riding around and doing the tour guide bit for a while. I showed them Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Blvd as well as `The Sunset Strip`. We went to a wax museum and did some roaming too. I also took them down Santa Monica Blvd and Beverly Hills. They really got a kick out of it all. When we did get back they crashed out pretty early.

Today we went to Universal Studios Hollywood. It was a lot better than I had expected. Some parts weren't that great and others were really nice. I still think Disneyland and California Adventure are more fun though. Tiffany is a huge Universal Studios advocate though. We made it there around 1:00 pm and had lunch at the `Hard Rock Cafe`. The park itself wasn't that bad. It felt a bit crowded and cramped but its a holiday weekend and I guess its what it should be like. We left the park around 8:00 pm when it was closing and got food on the way home. After I got in the car a flux of pain rushed too me because of my knee. It had been acting up all afternoon and I really do think that going out and walking around the park probly wasn't a good idea.

Tonight I set up <a href="http://montelepre.org">Montelepre.org</a> and there sub blogs for them. The entire process took about 30 minutes. I'm using <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> 4.6 and around 10 extra modules. They are going to be using them maily for image posting and galleries. We also got webmail and such up for them. Tomorrow I'll give them the tour on how everything works and what they can do.

Tomorrow is memorial day and I don't have work. Its really nice. I've made a ton of progress on <a href="http://bookmarks.com">Bookmarks.com</a> and will soon be ready for the push live. I can't wait until its up and going. <a href="http://blogsource.com">BlogSource.com</a> is also in its last stages of development and will soon be ready to go live too.

All in all, life isn't bad. Saturday was a big day for me in a lot of ways.
