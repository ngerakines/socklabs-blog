    Preparing for Dadhood
---

Once again, I left work a bit early and missed out of Foobar to join Carolyn at the childbirth preparation class. This was the second to last class and started off with a walking tour of El Camino Hospital. Since my knee was still bothering me and we already had the tour of Cal Pacific, I decided to opt out. When everyone got back class resumed and the topic of the night was episiotimies and caesarean sections.

We woke up early the next morning because I had a 7:00 am MRI appointment. It took about 30 minutes, but with the background noise and a pair of ear-plugs I fell asleep in the middle of it. It felt really weird though, and I really do wonder if scientists have really figured out the effects of magnetics on the human body. More on that another time.

At 9 we had a 'Taking care of baby' class which went really well. We were all assigned dolls and went through all of the motions. Didn't learning anything new per se, but got a few of my questions answered and I enjoyed it. Afterward we met up with Carolyn's mom for lunch. Afterward while at her mom's house I fell asleep and conked out for an hour and a half while everyone else was still talking. I felt kind of bad, but I must of needed a nap pretty badly.

We left soon after but Carolyn started to not feel so great. Her concern grew bigger, and after talking to the hospital we headed over and arrived about 10:00 pm. Thankfully nothing was wrong and what signs we did see were just misinterpreted as fatigue. We made it home around midnight and I conked out near instantly.

Sunday morning soon became afternoon. I told Carolyn that unless it was a life or death situation, I did not want to get up before 11:00 am. I think it was fair to say given the past few weeks. My schedule has turned into something that I wasn't expecting: A regular routine. I've been getting up at 6:00 am almost every day, catching the 7:05 am train and making it to the office right around 8:00. Anyway, it was 12:00 before we realized it and I got some 'me' time to do some programming and have some personal reflection.

A few hours later we headed over to her dad's house were we thought we would be helping some movers with furniture and packing. We soon found out that we would only be doing some packing and cleaning and the actual movers would be coming over on Thursday. Figures. We went through nearly everything and threw a lot out. It was really cool seeing some of her pictures and things from the past. I enjoyed myself. There was dinner and the more packing before we finally went home.

I have some laundry going and I'm going to take a shower. Its been a long weekend; I will sleep well.
