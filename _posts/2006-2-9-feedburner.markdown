A while ago I used FeedBurner for a very brief period of time. I switched back to regular feed links and such and figured that I would be fine. I've decided to switch to FeedBurner once again. They have come out with some very cool features and I'm really looking forward to seeing how they measure up.

3 of the major feeds on this site are now going through FeedBurner as a test run.
