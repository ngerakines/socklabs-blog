    Day 6 - About 60 miles away
---

Now that I'm not really in the city any more I'm starting to wonder if it makes sense to go day by day with the blogging.

The majority of day 6 was spenting packing and then driving to mom and dad's house in Florida. We made a quick stop into a waffle house for dinner, but we spent a good 6 hours on the road. At one point we stopped to get gas and I tried catching a kitten that was meowing at us, but we didn't get it.

It was nice seeing the family again, its been a while. Ben has turned emo, wearing girl pants and all, but charlie is still <i>normal</i>. Mom and dad are the same too. An old family friend, Raylin, is staying with them as well and working with dad.

The air matters that we picked up a few days ago was definitely worth it and the night ended with the two of us watching another episode of <i>Lost</i> with the brothers.

Carolyn and I are getting ready to do a podcast. Woohoot.
