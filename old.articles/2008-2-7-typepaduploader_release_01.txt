TypePad-Uploader 0.1 is ready for the public. This is the first and initial public release for this application. Please leave all of your questions and comments in the form of blog comments.

This application allows you to drag images from your desktop into the grey area of the application which uploads them directly to TypePad. Before you can do that though, you must first set the username, password and blog id to use. You can also drag the application by gripping the grey area and moving it where you please.
