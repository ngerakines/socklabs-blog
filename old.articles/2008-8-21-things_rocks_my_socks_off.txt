    Things rocks my socks off
---

From [Culture Code](http://culturedcode.com/) came an application called [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/). Things lets you organize tasks, projects and areas of responsibility and compliments the Getting Things Done idea. I've been using Things for a while now while it's in development and testing. It's one of the products that I've been using for so long that I can't image not continuing to use when the first official release comes out.

I also use mobile version of [Things for the Iphone](http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/). The price of $10 is pretty low and it hits the spot functionality-wise. This past week they released an upgrade for the application that now lets me sync the mobile and desktop applications via wifi. I couldn't be happier.

Cultured code has taken some flak because of how they have been releasing this pre-release version of their software with the idea that you'll pay for it when the official release is out. I think it's unjustified. What Cultured Code is doing is a great way to let users try your software without nag screens or limitations. It's honest and simple, much like Things.
