    Keeping Organized
---

I am a Perl developer. The only things that I can keep <em>really</em> organized and tidy are the things that I can check in and check out of a repository. To me, it is just a fact of life. This entry is started with that little bit of knowledge because today was a cleaning and household upkeep day. We've gone through and systematically cleaned most of the house. There is still laundry to do and a few other things here and there, but over all it was a great success.

We did run into one small quirk and that is my financial organization. No one wants to hear the big or great details about it, but Carolyn is much more fiscally organized than I am, and I thank The Creator for it. She wasn't totally appalled, per say, but my method of organizing paperwork, bills, tax information and so forth consists of a really large shoebox that goes under my bed.

Yeah.

So, in light of the need for better organization I convinced my wife that getting something like Quicken would probably be a really good call. It really didn't take much to convince her that I needed the help. Soo, I've gone through and tied all of our banking stuff together, categorized most everything from November of 2005 to today and even started on a budget. Its been really productive.

This isn't an ad for Quicken or anything, but I've never really felt this organized and informed about my money until now. I'm really impressed.

What I would love to see it do is: (1) Export the internal Quicken calendar to iCal. (2) Send me email updates and notifications. (3) Automate the reporting system.

Aside from that, it is working really well for me.
