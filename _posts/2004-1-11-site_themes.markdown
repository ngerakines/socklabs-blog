Howdy folks, this is a request for input on the site's theme, aka skin. Right now i'm testing the brown/pumpkin color scheme. Let me know if you like it by adding a comment to the post or emailing me. I'll probly do a new one each week and send them to the plog team as well as keep them in an archive. I'll add a link to download this one for yourself soon.
