    The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy
---

Recently I've had the pleasure of seeing <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</em> at one of the local theaters. I was quite excited and impressed with the witty dialog and subtle actions that make the book/movie great. I will admit that before hand I was a bit apprehensive about seeing the movie, fearing that it would not live up to the standards that I expected. Luckily it came out very well.

If you have some spare time and its playing near by go see it, you'll be very glad you did. I think that its also rated PG, so take your kids. They might not understand all of the dialog but there is a good bit of universal humor that they'll enjoy as much as you will.
