    OpenSUSE
---

A few weeks ago the hard drive on my computer failed on me. It was kind of expected on my part, as I've had it for a while now. It wasn't long until it was replaced and I was faced with the dilema of what Linux distrobution I would be using. I had really loved working with <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> but kinda wanted to try something different. As it happens, I made quick stop to LWE and picked up a few distro cds here and there, one of which was OpenSUSE.

The installation of OpenSUSE was very quick and easy. Having an instalation DVD makes it very simple. It picked up all of my hardware and drivers without any major configuration on my part. After about 30 minutes of installing the OS and then about 30 minutes of tweaking it for my own needs, I was up and running.

My experience so far has been very good. I have alot of questions and concerns about it though. Gentoo and Fedora both have huge communities behind them working and building new packages and such. What about OpenSUSE? How available are packages and mirrors for it? What is the likelyhood of the project dieing out because of Novell changing its mind on direction? I'm not really worried all too much, but I'm very used to being on the bleeding edge and this is a very much subdued and stable package only distrobution. After a month or so I plan or writing a more detailed review of how its gone for me.
