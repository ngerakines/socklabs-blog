Its 10:30 am and I'm at the office. Past few days have been productive and generally good. I've been writing a lot of code as well as documentation. And also a spec doc here and.

I've got a few minutes to kill while building right now and I was just on the iTunes store looking around. I saw that Ben Folds made an iTunes exclusive and took a look. I really do love his music. I think my favorite song of his is '<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ben+folds+lyric+philosophy">Philosophy</a>'. Aside from some of the good ole songs, there are some really great new ones. All in all I'm happy with it.

Listening to some of these songs brought brought a flood of memories. Its funny how music can do that. I remember causing trouble and having fun in Mandeville with all of my old friends. I remember Scott Gardner and hanging out in his house as his sister played a few of these songs. I remember listening these songs after I first moved out to California and dealing with being in a new place with no real place to call home. I remember ironing and cleaning during Air Force technical training school in Keesler while listening to the CD player and music that Beverly sent me. And those damn shirts that I still wear (and am wearing now). I remember going to the Ben Folds concert with Susan on my last birthday and how much fun I had with her that evening.

Hmmm.
