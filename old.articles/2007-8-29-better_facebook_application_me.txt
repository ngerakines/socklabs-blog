    Better Facebook Application Metrics

<img alt="facebookappmetrics.jpg" src="http://blog.socklabs.com/images/facebookappmetrics.jpg" width="205" height="126" style="margin: 5px;" align="left" /> I was logged into Facebook reading some documentation and on the Developer discussion boards and checked on the growth of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=cde8787f00c10c06e8a6d562aa4f129a">I Play WoW</a> to find some pretty cool new features. Now instead of showing total users (which was nice) it shows the number of daily active users and the percentage. I certainly hope there is a way to get the total number of users who have added the application, but seeing how many active daily there are is really sweet. I really like what I see.

Facebook made an announcement a few days ago saying that a large number of changes were coming. I'm looking forward to what they plan on doing about stemming the overly aggressive viral marketing tactics and forced invites with Facebook-supplied invitation and request forms. Being able to get more information out of the news feed and mini feed would also be really helpful.
