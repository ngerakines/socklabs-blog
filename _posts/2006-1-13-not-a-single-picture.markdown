    Not a single picture

I finally made it over to Macworld Expo today. A friend of mine let Carolyn barrow her pass so she could get in as well. I'll be brutally honest and admit that I think the show itself is incredibly boring. Unless you are a working the show or plan on buying stuff, there really isn't much to look at. I briefly played with the new iMacs and then iWeb, the new addition to iLife, but asside from that we just wandered. One person who I did run into and have a <a href="http://fanboy.urbanup.com/223164">fanboy</a> experience with was <a href="http://www.leoville.com/">Leo Laporte</a>.

I also decided not to take a single picture of the floor. I figure the internet is already flooded with more pictures than we will ever be able to consume, so why add more?

One thing I did do was open a safe-deposit box. The attendant let me take some pictures of the very old and very cool looking vault too.

That was my day, now I'm off to celebrate. Some big things going on that I'll be very happy to announce soon.
