I'm trying to post at least once a month now. I've been with Network Dynamics as the in house Database Admin. Its a good job and I like it so far. I work with a very cool and comfortable crew. There is so much to cover in the past month, it feels like nothing has stopped moving and changing. One of my closest friends, Brent, is coming out to California for a month while his fencing company is on tour out here. Anna is looking to goto school in Santa Barbara in the spring. Susan and I have calmed down and are hanging out every once in a while. I joined the <a href="http://www.pleonast.com">Pleonast</a> community. I moved servers from imhosted to <a href="http://www.Bocacom.net">Bocacom</a> and finally have a personal dedicated machine. Oh and yesterday there was a bomb threat at the building I work at in downtown Los Angeles, we were evacuated for over 3 hours.
