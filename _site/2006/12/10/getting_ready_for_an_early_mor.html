		 	<p>It is already kind of late, but there is more to do before I can call it a night. The past few days have been soo wonderful having my mom out here. We've been able to spend time together as a family. Carolyn, Vanessa, Terrie and myself have had a great time spending time together as a family, going out to dinner and just catching up on all that has been going on. None of this would be possible without Sharon's help and we are all very grateful for it. Without it, this probably wouldn't of happened.</p>

<p>Today started a little late because we slept in a bit. We picked her up around noon and went down to Pizza Antica for lunch and then over to the mall. We didn't stay very long because we floated the idea of going to IKEA the night before and my mom seemed pretty excited about it and decided to go. We made it out with a lamp and a french press. Not too bad I think.</p>

<p>After that we came back home and took a bit of a break and then headed out to pick up a few things at target and then over to dinner in Palo Alto. We went to the cheesecake factory and dinner was goood. The night before we went to 'La Fiesta' which was pretty good as well. We also got some super cute pictures of Vanessa and of mom and Vanessa together.</p>

<p>Although I'm really sad about not being able to go to Aaron's funeral and wake this past Friday and Saturday, it was really nice being around family and having my mom out here.</p>
