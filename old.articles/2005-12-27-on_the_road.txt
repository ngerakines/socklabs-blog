    On the road

With a wake-up call and a complimentary breakfast, we were soon out of Houston and on our way. To most the drive between Houston and El Paso would probably seem really dull and boring, however to me I really enjoy it. It really is bush country with low rolling hills. The farther west we got, the more mountains and plateaus we saw.

Anyway, Carolyn and I are making good time and hope to be back in San Francisco by the 28th/29th. I'm really excited, the entire trip has been a blast.

Well, we made it to El Paso around 7:30 pm local time. That gave us plenty of time to have dinner and settle somewhere. We were strongly debating just driving through to Phoenix but decided it would be easier and better if we just got a good night's rest. Once at the hotel, we pulled up google maps and found out that we are about 18 hours away from San Francisco.

And by the way, we are staying at a Ramada. This place is really nice. Out of all the hotels/motels I've stayed at, for what we payed this is clearly the best. And it has a free wifi hookup.
