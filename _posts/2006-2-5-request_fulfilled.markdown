Tonight I did some site upkeep and updated the <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap</a> files on the domains that I host and control. I logged into the google webmasters area and update the info, pretty regular.

I also gave logging into Google Analytics another go and it seemed to have worked. If this is because I was missing something last time then shame on me, but if someone intervened then thanks.

I use the handy Movable Type plugin called <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/google_analytic.html">Google Analytics</a> to easily install the js code that was needed. In a few days I hope that the graphs start to show some real info. I'm eager to get a feel for it.
