    The Atrocity Archives
---

<a href="http://www.exothermia.net/">Eric</a> was in town a few weeks ago suggested a book that he had recently finished. The name of it is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1930846258">The Atrocity Archives</a>. I got it that night but didn't actually start reading it until yesterday. I have to admit that it comes across as very .. <em>weird</em> .. but it really brings out a very unique and attractive style.
