    Car wreck eq headache
---

I'm in the airport in Phoenix, AZ. My plans changed when we got in a car wreck on I-10 leaving Phoenix. I'm ok, and so is Carolyn, but it doesn't look so good. I have a really bad headache and I have this gut feeling that I'm going to be sore in the morning.

Wish us luck.
