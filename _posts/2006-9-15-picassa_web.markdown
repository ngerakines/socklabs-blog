    Picassa web
---

Since I had a few minutes to spare this morning I was reading the 'news' and saw that Picassa web albums are now available to the public. I'm waiting for the day that Google decides to release a mac os x client for Picassa, but on that same note I'm also waiting for a mac os x Google Desktop app as well. Who knows if that'll ever happen though.

The web version of picassa seems nice enough, but it isn't anything compared to flickr. I think disk space limits are silly, especially when the goal is to encourage photo taking and posting. I could easily upload a gig and a half if I wanted to try to sync my picassa web account and my flickr account. I think this is one of those products that has good intentions but the 'umph' just isn't enough. Such is life.

I havn't done anything special or grand with it, nor do I plan on it, but you can check out what web albums look like.
