title: I Play WoW: RIP

It is official: the Facebook application I Play WoW is officially gone. It wasn't until earlier this week that I noticed that the Facebook application bookmark for it wasn't showing up. I'm very sad to see that the new owners decided to delete it, but it was their decision.

Here are some fun facts to remember it by:

 * At the time of the sale, it had over 1.7 million unique users, 4.5 of 5 stars with over 2,000 reviews and over 200,000 monthly active users.
 * There were over 4 million characters tracked by I Play WoW in over 3.1 million guilds.
 * The most commonly used feature was the 'Ding' feature. Next was 'Share Achievement'.
 * We gave over 200 hours of game time away by giving away game cards to users who submitted usefull feedback or bug reports.
 * It launched 2 weeks after the Facebook platform was announced. That's 3 years ago!
 * Carolyn and I have replied to over 750 support requests.
 * It's been featured on sites like wow.com, download.com and others.
 * The first user icon set was created by the Live Journal wow-icons group.
 * We've gotten numerous responses from users telling us about how the social aspect of I Play WoW has helped them. The most memorable was "I didn't know 20 of my friends from Highschool played and now we play together." Another really good one was "I didn't know my siter's new fiance played."

Obviously I'm very sad to see that it is gone, but I've got a lot of good memories and some great experiences. It was a 3 year side project that I really enjoyed and, in the end, a lot of other people enjoyed it too.
