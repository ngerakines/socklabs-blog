    Congressional blogs

Denny Hastert, the speaker of the house, has announced that he has started his own blog. First glance shows that you can't comment or give any sort of feedback, but that is expected. Unfortunately you can't subscribe to any sort of feed either and that is quite disappointing.

This provokes me to ask: Are there any other known politicians have blogs or any sort of online presence?
