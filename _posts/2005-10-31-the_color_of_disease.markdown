I was going to try to be witty and think of a title in relation to the black plague and spam. Don't think it really worked.

We've been dealing with more and more spam lately. I must admit that I am quite proud and satisfied with the amount of spam we are flatly rejecting from our systems. Sooner or later we'll make some sort of announcement on the state of spam filtering.

The filter and ruleset that has been building over the recent months is growing quite complex. It also very amusing to see how some rules gain momentum and then fade off over time. It really goes to show how adaptive spammers really are.
