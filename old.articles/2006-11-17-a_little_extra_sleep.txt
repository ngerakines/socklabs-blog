    A little extra sleep
---

Carolyn the most skillful managed to put Vanessa to sleep almost 2 hours early tonight. I was very grateful for the extra sleep. The past few days have really been a lot and by the time I got home last night I was almost ready to pass out. Its not that I'm doing anything that is physically taxing, but rather I've absorbed soo much information that I end up mentally exhausted. It sounds kind of silly, but its been a lot of work.

Because of what has been going on with the new job and at home, I really haven't had the time to blog much lately. Next week I'll have slightly more time to myself. I'm also really excited about posting while I'm in Las Vegas. It'll be my first time there.
