    Cooking
---

Since Carolyn has been doing most of (well all really) of the baby feeding I've had the chance to do a bit more in the kitchen. No, I'm not saying that I volunteer to do the dishes more than I did before, I'm talking about cooking and feeding us. Its kind of nice because it makes me feel like there is something else I can do to help out.

Even better though is this upcoming Sunday (my birthday) when Carolyn and I get to go have dinner to ourselves. That, is a real treat.
