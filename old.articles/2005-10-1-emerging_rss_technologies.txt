A few days ago I started using the service FeedBurner. It basically rewrites feeds on the fly to allow for better stats and tracking as well as other services like entry onto the feedmesh and even monotization by inserting google ads.

I'm a bit indiferent myself. If Feedster ever came out with something similiar I'd definately move toward it without any hesitation.

I should also point out that both <a href="http://exothermia.net">Eric</a> and <a href="http://www.second-level.com">Scott</a> have switched to this recently as well.
