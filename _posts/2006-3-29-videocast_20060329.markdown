What I forgot to mention: I got an iTunes season pass of "The Daily Show" and watching it on the way home from work. Also got the game "Lemonade Tycoon" for my cell phone. Taking lots of pictures from my mobile phone as well. Met <a href="http://maenad.net">Maenad</a> another San Francisco blogger while doing laundry. She used blogging as an excuse to be late for something and I found that really really funny.
