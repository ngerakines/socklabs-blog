		 	<p>I saw today on WoWInsider that patch 2.3 is rolling out to the PTRs soon. The change log as it stands is huge. There are a large number of changes to PVP which will definitely change the currently used strategies on AV. There are also a few new spells and skill introduced, including the new 'expertise' rating that sounds like it was taken straight out of D&amp;D.</p>

<p>Blizzard has also changed the leveling structure to make decrease the time it takes to get from 20 to 60. This includes the addition of quests to several key areas where good quests were really lacking. Maybe it was a good idea to hold off on leveling Corale all this time? Maybe rolling a druid wouldn't be so bad now.</p>

<p>Priests are getting buffed slightly with the way bonus healing is applied to some spells. There are also several buffs for mages that Carolyn is going to enjoy. Engineers will also be able to create flying mounts (!!) which might indicate a shift in usefulness for the engineering skill. I'm still a bit skeptical on that.</p>

<p>What I'm really excited to see is the new guild banking support. Players have been asking for this for a while now and its finally arrived. I've have one to many experiences with an exploding bank because I end up storing all of the guild extras and dole them out to who needs them. Being able to take the dependancies off of players (and bank-alts) will be really nice.</p>

<p>As the changes are watched on the PTRs and the game balance is observed, I'm looking forward to seeing what else arrives comes out of 2.3.</p>
