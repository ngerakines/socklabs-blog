    Lot of coding going on
---

Doing alot of coding. Project at work has really got me going. You ever get on a roll and start loosing track of time and space? Its sad to admit, but once I started programming and before I realized it I hadn't gotten out of my chair for 18 hours strait. After I realized it I was soo flippin hungry it wasn't funny. I guess everyone has a vice or so. I won't say mine is programming, but I will say that sometimes going 150% isn't always good.

This week looks exciting. Alot going on at the office, alot going on at home. Just a few weeks from my birthday, for what its worth. It feels like just another day I guess. Had fun today, went out to San Jose. Got back kinda late but I'm kinda glad I had a bit extra time. Picked up a new book, "<a href="http://isbndb.com/search-all.html?kw=0871316021">Born in Blood</a>", and I'm really loving it so far. I could see myself being a history teacher.
