		 	<p>This is a 'batch' blog post. Its basically a week or more worth of blog entries crammed into a single entry usually because I've been so busy up until this sweat moment of calm.</p>

<p>Today I updated the site theme. I found a really cool theme on <a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/">The Style Contest</a> that really stood out to me and decided to go for it. It also gave me a good excuse to update the templates and slim them down a bit. I don't think it was a huge enough change to make it go any faster, but the page size and such has decreased. I've also brought up the search box and update the site map. Have fun.</p>

<p>Yesterday Carolyn and I went to the <a href="http://www.saratogarotary.org/artshow/">Saratoga Rotary Art Show</a>. We didn't stay too long but we did manage to explore the entire event and even stop by a few booths to check out what we liked. That got us talking about the types of art that we both prefer and I have a better feeling of what she likes. We also started thinking about putting up some pieces in and around the house.After that we went to a mall and wandered around for a while. We sat through a 20+ minute demonstration of a <a href="http://www.bose.com/">Bose</a> home theatre system which was great. I am super impressed.</p>

<p>Most of the time was spent just wandering in the mall. We got a lot of ideas for the house and what we want to do with the place. I also saw a really cool book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0740755617">Book of Secrets</a>, which I added to my wish list. For lunch we had mongolian BBQ, it was good.</p>

<p>On Saturday <a href="http://hachi.livejournal.com">Hachi</a> came over in the late afternoon and we went over to the pool hall for a while. Hachi is a lot better than he admits, so is Carolyn for that matter. It was fun and we ended up cooking dinner for the three of us and hanging out for a while.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I also finished the game NeverWinter Nights, much to Carolyn's delight. Once you get to the 3rd and 4th chapters the game goes by real quickly. I'll keep up with maintaining the wiki but for now I'm taking a look at some of the modules and add-ons that you can get for it. While I was in the mall I saw a box for 'NeverWinter Nights 2', can anyone confirm this?</p>

<p>On Friday I left work early so Carolyn and I could catch Mission Impossible 3. I missed out on <a href="/tag/foobar">FooBar</a> which I heard was fun, but the movie wasn't bad. Thats how we found the pool hall actually. We got tickets for the 9:10 pm showing, but got to the theatre around 6:30 pm and had a lot of time to kill. Carolyn was really worried about super long lines but when we got to the theatre it was empty so we started looking for ways to kill time. Near the movie theatre is a nice little pool hall so we went there for an hour and a half. It was a lot of fun. I'm probably not going to write a full review of mi3, but my recommendation is to wait until its available to rent and spend 5 bucks on it. The movie isn't <em>great</em> but its not that bad either.</p>

<p>Last week was a busy work week. I had a much needed trip to the dentist, although I've got 2 more in the next month already schedule :(. I also went to the stated meeting at Mountain View lodge. I got to meet some of the brethren and hang out. I'm looking forward to being more active.</p>
