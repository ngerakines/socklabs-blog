    Pleonast and how much it rocks.
---

A few years ago a guy named <a href="http://www.pleonast.com/kennon">Kennon</a> started a blogging community. Over time new members came and went, and now what is left is a matured ( and still growing ) blogging community.

I was introduced to <a href="http://www.pleonast.com/">pleonast</a> by <a href="http://www.pleonast.com/susan">Susan</a> about a year and a half ago. I went in as a complete stranger with only one person on the friends list and was impressed at how friendly and open the entire community is.

Recently I became a gold member ( paying member ) to show my support. I did this not because I use it very often or because I need to, but because I want to support something that I like and trust.

Pleonast makes an excellent alternative to other blogging sites out there like blogger and blog-city, because of its very plain and simple purpose: to let you communicate.
