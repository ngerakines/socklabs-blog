    Tabbed chat!
---

I've been using the default ichat client for my instant messaging. Its small, fast and doesn't have tons and tons of features that I'll never use. It does lack some of the cool things that I really like in some of the other clients like Adium. Mainly tabbed windows and growl support.

Here comes <a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax</a>, a swiss-army-knife for ichat. The most recent version ( 1.4.1 ) has tabbed window support! My chat client has just entered the 21st century and I'm elated.
