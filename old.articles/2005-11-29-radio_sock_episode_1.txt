    Radio Sock: Episode 1
---

We've recorded our first podcast episode here at Socklabs and it is ready for the world. Tonight we discussed a lot of random stuff, the web, where it is going and what is going on. I don't claim that it is great or anything, but it is a start and will get better in time.
