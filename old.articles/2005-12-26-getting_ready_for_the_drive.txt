    Getting ready for the drive
---

So after a good bit of consideration, Carolyn and I are planning on driving back to San Francisco. We'll end up getting back a lot sooner and it just sounds like a fun drive. It'll take 2-3 days but we think it'll be well worth it. We'll post more while on the road and we've got a lot to prepare for.

More later.
