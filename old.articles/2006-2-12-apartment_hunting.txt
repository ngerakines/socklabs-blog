    Apartment hunting
---

Carolyn and I have been out all day checking out apartments. We've both tentatively decided that we really like the inner/outer sunset area right along the N line. We checked out once place in that area and then took the bus to the richmond district to see a few places around there. Richmond was terribly disappointing to say the least.

Right now we are taking a break and stopped back at the house to get some food and relax. We've got one more appointment for 6:00 pm near 28th Ave in sunset, but until then I think the plan is to get some Jamba Juice.

Wish us luck!

<em>Update: </em> Things went really well! We met with Tracy, they owner of the property right around 6:00 pm. For better, we arrived about 45 minutes early and had a chance to walk around the area and to the park to get a feel for it. We've got high hopes!
