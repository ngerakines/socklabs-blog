Today I bought a box of magic cards of the `Ravnica` series. I got some really great cards out of it and I've got 3 decks in the making. Next chance I get, I'll buy some lands and start play testing these decks. To be honest I really only wanted to get one card, which was "<i>Razia, Boros Archangel</i>" with the goal of adding it to my current angel deck. However, it worked out that I can easily create a red/white deck and throw it in there as well. I think it was a good purchase in the end.

I've received a lot of unsettling news lately. Some with friends, some with work. It feels like life is a bit off balance right now, but I'm sure that after a few days things will mellow out and return to normal. Most of all, I'm quite concerned about Britany, a friend of mine back in southern California.

Lodge has been great and I'm really glad that I have a home now. I've also been quite active since becoming a coach and helping out candidates. It is very fulfilling.

Picked up a new notebook; How wonderful the feel of paper against my fingers is, they dance upon the ink, it mingles with my dreams.
