This weekend we put up the tree and some decorations and made a holiday peppermint-chocolate fudge too. We are still having some issues with the tree its got lights and some ornaments and thats that. I think Sharon is going to come over some time this week and help Carolyn with the tree a bit.

I still have some shopping to do, and I think Carolyn does as well, but things are winding up and I'm really looking forward to my christmas break. As stressful as the past few months have been, this christmas is going really well and I'm happy to spending it with the people around me.
