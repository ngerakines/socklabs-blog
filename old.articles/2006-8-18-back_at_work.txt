    Back at work
---

I'm glad to be back at work. This morning I slept a little late and had to rush to get out of the door to catch the train but I made it with a few minutes to spare. Last night I foolishly fell asleep around 8:45 pm and the TV woke me up around 10:00 pm which kept me up until 2:00 am. That isn't very fun but thats what I get for taking a power nap like that.

My knee is feeling better but I'm really trying to be careful on it. I decided not to bring my crutches to work. I don't like them and they make me feel incapable. Maybe its just my own insecurity flaring out, but its good enough reason for me.

I've got a lot in the TODO for today. I was thinking about getting another haircut (I like keeping it short-ish) but I don't really know if that is feasible right now.

Tonight is the El Camino hospital tour. I don't think that I'll go but there will be class afterward. I think I'll just hang out in the classroom with a book.

And on the subject of books, today I stopped at the mailbox on the way to work to find some of the books that I ordered from Amazon. This should keep me entertained for the next few weeks.
