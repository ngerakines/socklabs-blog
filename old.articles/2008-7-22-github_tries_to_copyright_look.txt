    Github tries to copyright 'look and feel'
---

What is this you say? GitHub actually states that the "look and feel" are copyright to them? That they say you can't reuse any of the "design elements"? Yeah, I had to see it for myself to believe it. On their Terms of Service they clearly state this.

> The look and feel of the Service is copyright©2008 Logical Awesome LLC. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from Logical Awesome.

Its almost laughable that they go so far to say that no one can look like them or do what they do. Its almost as bad as 37 Signils trying to copyright the idea of paper layouts and structured data. This is ridiculous. I'm a big fan of GitHub and pay for their services, but this is too much. This sort of behavior is nothing short of bullying and intimidation to keep other people from making cool stuff.
