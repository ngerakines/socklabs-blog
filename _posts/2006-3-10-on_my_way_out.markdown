    On my way out
---

This afternoon Carolyn and I will be taking a flight down to Los Angeles. I'll be out of town for a few days but will have my laptop with me. Won't keep me from hacking away, so just drop me an email if you need to get ahold of me.

Plans: Mutaytor show, touching base with Eric and Amanda, stopping by my old place on Sunset, getting all of my old stuff out of storage, picking up the Grand Am and road tripping up to the bay.

Even better this would all be if we could take everything strait to the new apartment. *crosses fingers*
