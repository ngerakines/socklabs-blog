    My first Facebook App
---

I created my first official Facebook app called 'I Play WoW'. It is a very small app that lets users record the World of Warcraft characters they have and then display them on their profile.

The front-end is powered by Catalyst + Data::ObjectDriver + Template Toolkit and it is backed by MySQL + memcached. It entirely FBML based and uses custom logic to submit profile and user feed changes.
