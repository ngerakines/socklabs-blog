Its been over 2 weeks since I've been in the office and I'm on my way as I
write this. As fate would have it, last night was not easy on me. Neither I
nor Vanessa could get to sleep very easily. I think I finally went to sleep a
little after 2:15 am and then around 4:00 am I got up to put Vanessa back to
sleep and change her diaper. Oddly enough I woke up about a minute before the
alarm went off and even better, it didn't wake up Vanessa.

It felt very funny walking to the caltrain station in the dark. As dark as it
was, the streets were really busy. I'm looking forward to getting some coffee
before I head in, I think its going to be a long day.
