    New Server, Gentoo Installation
---

James and I are starting a side project that I came up with a while ago but didn't really have the time to start hacking at. I found a pretty good deal on a p4 with 2g ram and a 160gig hd and decided to run with it. What is different is that I'm doing an entire Gentoo installation remotely. I know its done a lot but I've never done it before and its a new experience. I found a few really handy quick install guides and the one that I'm using seems pretty good.

I decided to go with Gentoo instead of Fedora or Debian for a few different reasons. One of the biggest being that I feel like it is easier to upgrade. An `emerge -u world` is a hell of a lot easier than trying to manage and maintain a multitude of apt-get repositories and dependancy hell.

I've got a flight tonight to southern California so I won't be able to finish the entire install right now, but I think I'll get through the first half of the `emerge -u system` before I have to leave the office. They pretty much booted a livecd and configured the networking to enable sshd access and let me hack at it. This is awesome.
