    I need noise to work
---

I'm at the coffee house down the street because by 9:00 pm it was getting to quite at the office for me to be productive on any level. I'm kinda suprised that I'm not starting to burn out already. I've got some major deadlines coming up that have to be ready. Its not a matter of pushing them off by a week or anything, they have to be complete.

I think that somewhere, deep inside, I really do revel in the pressure and stress. I've always thought that I work harder and better with more focus and concern for the project at hand, when the pressure is on.

Aside from work I'm kinda worried about a few things. But bah, why focus on the negative?

I talked to Anna today and I think we'll get to meet up soon. She and Greg have been busting ass with school and work the past year, its really commendable. Its very cool to see things working out so well.

Anyway, I'm not all here. I'm going to get back to work. More to do... more to do...

Ohh and on a side note:
