Roxanna came over to visit for a while so I gave the courtesy of putting my computer down while she was here. We went to <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/details?id=21316648&state=CA&city=Mountain+View&stx=Sushi+Tomi&csz=Mountain+View%2C+CA&fr=&ed=n8kAg6131DxDgGukjbbLm9B.38vUvaCQGsYRlHcvwZoZImT8vhMnTh3bdQ--&lcscb=ufEKJitSRZy">Sushi Tomi</a> and then came back to hang out a bit had watched some more ER. The past few episodes have been really good and I feel that I have been completely sucked in. Before we went out for dinner we were at the starbucks on Shorline catching up.

I don't have any set plans for tonight. Yesterday while we were at the mall I picked up the book <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22The+God+Delusion%22">The God Delusion</a> by <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Richard+Dawkins%22">Richard Dawkins</a> as recommended by Eric a few months back. I'm really interested in finally reading it.

Tomorrow morning we are going to a family christmas party around lunch. I don't know about plans for the rest of the day. I've never been crazy into New Year's eve parties or celebration.
