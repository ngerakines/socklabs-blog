    Tuesday Ritual
---

Its tuesday afternoon and I'm on the train heading home from work. Today Carolyn has been feeling a little sick and I've been pretty busy and productive at work. The next few days are going to be very busy for both of us.

Yesterday an old friend from Los Angeles, <a href="http://www.yoak.com">Jeff Yoak</a>, called and and said he was going to Ad-Tech and wanted to know if I wanted to hang out while he was out here. I was thrilled enough and eventually offered the spare bedroom for a few nights to save him the trouble. Apparently the convention is at the Moscone center which is right up the street from my office and figure it'll work nicely for him. Plus, anything to save him from dealing with the drive and parking every day isn't so bad.

So Jeff is coming over late tonight and will be staying until Friday or so. We havn't really had the chance to catch up in a very long time so I'm really looking forward to it. I really got along well is Jeff and Kate while at Oversee and enjoy his company.

Earlier this afternoon I got a call from <a href="http://www.gradman.net/">Eric Gradman</a> and he told me that he's in Sunnyvale. What are the odds? Its like an oversee ex-employee reunion. Its pretty funny how it all works out but I think we are going to go get drinks or something and rant about life.

I'm kinda bummed that Jeff's wife Kate didn't have the chance to come out as well but she's 3 due and heavens knows that she shouldn't be traveling this close to the due date.

In other news Byrne's wife Arin gave birth this past weekend to a beautiful baby girl, Hailey. At the office I got a quick hello from him while he's at home for the time being. I'm so excited for him and can't wait to hear more.
