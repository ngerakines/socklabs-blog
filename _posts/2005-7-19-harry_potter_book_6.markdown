    Harry Potter, Book 6
---

In the mail arrived the 6th book in the Harry Potter series and I must say  that I was quite eager to have it. I ordered it a while ago from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon.com</a> not wanting to deal with getting it at a book store or anything.

As soon as I started on the first page I knew that I wouldn't be able to put it down or let go until it was finished. Chapter by chapter went by as I was gripped firmly and strung along its plot of twists and turns. I was thuroughly impressed at the find job the author did with this book and it was nothing short of a great work.

I won't give any spoiler information, but I will say that the end of the book left me sad and confused. Its a shame that we will have to wait so long for the next and final installment of the serries to arrive.

If you havn't read it, I implore you to spend the 15 dollars that it requires and get at it right away. It is an excellent read that will have you in suspense and immersed in its action.
