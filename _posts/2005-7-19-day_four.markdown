    Day Four
---

The fourth, and last, day of my trip was very exciting and brought back most of my memories of home. That morning I woke up bright and early to check out and have my things ready to leave. It was decided that Aaron and I would have breakfast at <em>Cafe' du Monde</em> in the morning and hang out in the city until my flight left.

It didn't take long to get there and parking was pretty lax too. I had a cup of coffee to sip on while I waited for the two of them to arrive. It sure was nice, I will admit. It was a bit hot and muggy but wasn't overwhelming in anyway. They eventually made it and we had a quick breakfast and then walked around the french quarter for a while. I took a ton of pictures and even picked up a few things here and there.

When we decided to go, we took the long way to the airport and went through city park and the lakeshore area to see my old house. Oddly enough we happened to run into Toni who was walking to her car as I was driving down. We met up and exchanged hugs and funny glances and we were soon off.

Eventually we made it to the airport and Aaron and Brandi sent me off. I was sad to go, very sad, but I was ready. I would of loved to stay longer but couldn't change my flight, else I might have. The flight home was pretty smooth. Wrote most of the way back and did some reading.

The mustang was waiting for me just where I left it, and thats where the story ends.
