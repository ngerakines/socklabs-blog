The baby shower this weekend went much better than I was expecting. I could almost say that I really enjoyed myself and had a good time. It was great to see Anna and Greg again and I'm looking forward to seeing them again some time soon. I should also mention that we made off pretty darn good.

I think sooner or later Carolyn is going to blog about everything and even post some pictures.
