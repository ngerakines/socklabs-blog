    I love Tivo
---

I'm not a TV person. I know this, we know this. And yes when I say 'we' I am in fact reffering to the entire collective knowledge that is the internet. With that said, I sure am happy to have Tivo. I've been able to watch shows that I want to watch, things that interest me. Carolyn and I even started watching 'Survivor' together now that we don't have to be constrained by time to enjoy a TV show. It makes such a huge difference and really frees you from the restraint of having to schedule TV time.

I'd go so far as to say that the ability to watch a show whenever I want completely and totally trumps fast-forwarding through commercials (Even though that in and of itself is frick'n cool). Having Tivo is definitely a good thing.
