    Presenting at CUFP
---

The post I recently made regarding the use of Erlang in Delicious has gotten a fair amount of attention. To follow up as "not just another erlang blogger", I'd like to refer people to the CUFP presentation that Mark Zweifel and myself will be giving at CUFP. We will be giving an overview of how, where and why Erlang was used and how it fit our needs. I'll also be covering how Erlang is used in other parts of Yahoo (officially and unofficially). Mark and I might also go through a brief round of Q&A depending on how long the presentation lasts.

I'm fairly certain that all of the CUFP presentations will be available online once the conference is over. As the conference approaches I'll post a more detailed abstract of the presentation. If you have a question that you'd like answered during the presentation please email me at [nick+cufp@gerakines.net](mailto:nick+cufp@gerakines.net).

Please refer to the official [CUFP website](http://cufp.galois.com/) and [list of presentations](http://cufp.galois.com/2008/abstracts.html) for more information.
