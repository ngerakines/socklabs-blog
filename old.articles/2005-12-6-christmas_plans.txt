    Christmas plans
---

I've purchased my plane tickets to fly down to New Orleans for christmas this year. I'm very excited to get back to the city and see everyone. Its been a very busy year, not just for me but for everyone in the family. I'll also get the chance to see Brent and Emily too. Maybe some of the old gang as well.
