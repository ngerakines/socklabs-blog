    Anna is coming over
---

Anna is staying with us for the weekend, something which we've been trying to do for a while. Now we are just hanging out and enjoying some quiet time. Vanessa is asleep and we've got some time to ourselves. We've spent the last few days cleaning the house and catching up on the many things that have needed to be done but havn't been.

I think the plan was that we would head up to the city tomorrow morning but we realized that tomorrow is St. Patrick's day. There is supposed to be a parade and I suspect driving through the city won't be easy. Who knows though, it may turn out well. Either way we are all looking toward a fun weekend.
