		 	<p><a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a> won't die in 2006. I've seen a few articles here and there that try to paint a negative ( read: pessimistic ) picture for the feed search engine. I don't think they give an accurate or realistic view of what Feedster is, what it has and where it will be by the end of this year.</p>

<p>Feedster has several really awesome things going for it, some of them many people don't even see or realize. Feedster has been creating a huge knowledge-base of information gathered from several years of storing, not just feeds, but the meta-data of these feeds. This literally allows them map out the entire life-span of a feed. While I was at Feedster there were several times when a blogger would loose all of his or her posts and would be able to use the index to literally restore the blog back to it's fullest. That alone is an awesome ability.</p>

<p>Another thing that Feedster has is a strong spam filtering system. It is my opinion that, like all spam systems, it needs some upkeep but it is extremely flexible and powerful. When it peeked, it boasted a very  high accuracy rate and worked extremely well. I can't and won't say that it is perfect because all anti-spam systems are flawed and out of date, but it is damn good.</p>

<p>I can also say that Feedster is really ontop of things when it comes to time accuracy. In several tests, inside and outside of Feedsterland, it takes under 15 minutes for a blog to go live and Feedster to have it sucked down and indexed.</p>

<p>On the business side they have a number of partnerships. They've got contacts in the industry who feel confident and show faith in the services that they provide. Feedster has some very smart and talented people working on business relationships and product development.</p>

<p>How do I know this? Because I worked at Feedster in 2005 and loved it. I was in charge of the development of the Crawler and its related projects. I left in mid December on my own accord. Not because of influence or incident, but because I gave serious thought and pursued moving down to Louisiana to assist with family matters after Katrina. I know Feedster from inside out and feel very strongly that it isn't just a technology company that will fade into the mists, but one that will continue to make an impact on the ever changing blog-o-sphere.</p>
