    CloudNine 2.4
---

<a href="http://www.saltpeppervinegar.co.uk/">Tim Knight</a> emailed me and made a few suggestions and feature requests that I really liked. Inspired by that, CloudNine is now at version 2.4 and comes with some enhancements that really make it shine. The latest revision now includes <em>real</em> color schemes and gradients. All colors in the scheme should be web safe as well.

With a little hunting I found the following perl modules: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ian/Color-Scheme">Color::Scheme</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jeffa/Color-Spectrum">Color::Spectrum</a>. After a little hacking, I've included the base features from both and now in the settings you can specify a starting color (6 char hex string) point and it will automatically create a color scheme and then color gradient from that scheme.
