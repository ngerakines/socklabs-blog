    CPAN Additions

I made a contribution to CPAN as part of the WWW::Search set. Its called <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/">WWW::Search::UrbanDictionary</a> and is an interface that allows you to easily make lookups on <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/">UrbanDictionary.com</a> and sift through the results. It uses the SOAP API provided by Aaron and works pretty well. If anyone has any contributions please feel free to email them to me.
