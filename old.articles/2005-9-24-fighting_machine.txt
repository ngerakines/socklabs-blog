In other news, I've got to have my stuff out of my old place by Monday. I briefly talked to Corey online and was leaving the hint that my stuff needs to go. It was bound to happen, and frankly I'm suprised they let me keep some of my stuff there so long. The only thing I've got real concern for is the dressor and the desk. Everything else can be packed into 4 or 5 boxes.
