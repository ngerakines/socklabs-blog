    Recent Earthquakes
---

Recently there's been a good deal of earthquak activity on the pacific coast. Today while in a meeting there was a 5.3 that gave the room a good shake. It freaked me out because it was my first <strong>real</strong> earthquake experience. Some of the people at work were pretty rattled and others shrugged it off as if it were nothing.

What really strikes me is that some friends south and west felt it too. I guess its just a new concept to think that there is a force so strong that it can have such a strong affect. It wasn't until today that I gave the earthquake idea some serious thought in relation to my life and those around me.

On a positive note, I'd like to say that it made me very happy to see news of it on <a href="http://www.newsalerts.com/">NewsAlerts</a> within minutes. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.
