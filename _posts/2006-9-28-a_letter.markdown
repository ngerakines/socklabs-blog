    A Letter
---

Vanessa,

This morning I held you for the first time. One of your first moments in this world was in your mother and father's arms. Within seconds Carolyn was struck and started crying and laughing all at once know that you, our daughter, was finally here, in our arms, absorbing everything that this world had to offer. We were overwhelmed with joy, happiness, fear and love. There is soo much that you will experience from the most beautiful moments with your friends, family and wilderness to the worst and unspeakable. Just know that with every breath I take I love you more than anything in this world and that I am right behind you every step of the way.

With all of the love I possess,

Nick Gerakines
