    HamOrSpam
---

So a few days ago Noel and I were talking about how funny it would be to setup a hot-or-not clone site but the premise of it would be judging wether something is ham or spam. In the moment I went and registered the domains <a href="http://hamorspam.com">hamorspam.com, .net and .org</a>. I figure sooner or later I'll get something actually up and make a big joke out of it all.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions send them my way.
