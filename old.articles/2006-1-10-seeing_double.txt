Today has been quite the busy one. I'm in San Jose and got word not too long ago that today the folks over at Apple announced a dual core intel powerbook. Wow. There were lots of predictions about intel ibooks and bigger displays, but nothing like this. I guess its safe to say that if you are going to go, <em>Go Big</em>.

I'm listening to the keynote and will make my speculations very soon.
