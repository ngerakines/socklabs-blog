Today has been an uber long day. I left work early to meet Carolyn back at the ER shortly after lunch. Her situation hasn't improved really and not only was I very concerned, but Sharon was also pretty worried too. Aside from being there from 1:50 pm to 10:30 pm, the doctor couldn't find anything wrong after another set of extended tests and sent us home with a prescription and told us to come back if it doesn't get any better.
