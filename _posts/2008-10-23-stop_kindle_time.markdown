    Stop, Kindle Time
---

Oh oh oh oh, dun dun dun dun duunnn, kindle time.

Ok, I'm done for now. Yesterday for my 25th birthday I got an Amazon Kindle. I'm super excited about having one because I've had my eye on it for a long time. It was one of those "ok, I really want one now and if I want one this badly in a few months then I'll get one" sort of gadgets. In the end waiting paid off. I didn't bother taking any unboxing pictures but I thought about it for a second. They did a good job with packaging it although it was slightly wasteful. 

I really love how clean the display looks. I've got a subscription to the local news paper and picked up a few books that have been lurking on my Amazon Wish List.

My book list currently has "The Mythical Man-Month" by Frederick P. Brooks, "The Pragmatic Programmer" by by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, "The Post-American World" by Fareez Zakaria, "The Quotable Atheist" by Jack Huberman, "Foundation" by Isaac Asimov, and "Spook Country" by William Gibson. I'm about half-way through "The Mythical Man-Month" already.

After the rush of having something that I've been wanting for a while dies down, I'll look at this review again and collect my thoughts about it. I'm optimistic that this is going to be a very good thing that lasts a while.
