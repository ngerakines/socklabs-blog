    Masonic Contributions
---

Masons are compelled to contribute to the lodge they are a member of and to the fraternity as a whole. I don't know of any Masons who would argue or disagree with that. What I'm not entirely sure is how our members would interpret what a contribution is.

Most would first think that a contribution is material or monetary. I would like to talk about other Masonic contributions which are usually just as worthy if not held in greater respect.

Contributing to your lodge can be done in countless ways. One can be by going through the line and becoming an officer, another can be becoming a coach or mentoring another brother. What most don't realize is that the time and energy you invest in your brothers is worth much more than your yearly dues.

What I see a general lack of is an understanding of how brothers can help. In most cases the members of a lodge are perfectly willing and capable of contributing to each other, but often lack ideas or creative inspiration as to how and where.

What I want to ask to you and through you to yourself: How can I contribute to my lodge? Who is in need? Who is going through the line and needs some coaching or a little extra encouragement? Who hasn't shown up in a while and could use a friendly phone call? Are the Jobs Daughters planning a trip and need an extra chaperone? Does Eastern Star need help in the kitchen for there next meeting? What can I do to show my appreciation for a brother?

These are the simple questions that one can ask to find one of the many ways to contribute. I close with one simple fact, as you contribute to your lodge, you contribute to your brothers and you contribute to yourself, for The Great Architect of the Universe created all of us equally and worthy of each other's contribution.
