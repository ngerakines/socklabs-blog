    All that Jazz
---

I just got back from this awesome jazz club in chinatown with Corey and Jerome. I would of never expected to walk into such a cozy little lounge on a Wednesday night, but alas life is the unexpected. I immediately thought of two people that would absolutely love it. First being Susan and second being Emily. I'm thinking of stopping by on Saturday night during on of there bigger shows and checking out the scene.

Some crazy things have been going on in the house lately. Nothing that deeply effects me or whats going on in my life, but present never the less. For those who pray, pray for Corey and his family. It can't hurt.

The rest of the week looks good. Alot going on at work with <a href="http://www.newsalerts.com/">NewsAlerts</a> and its inner workings. Check it out for some very awesome updates that have been made lately.

That night I was up until 3:00 relearning how to play the piano again. I guess I was inspired. I learned the song `<em>My Favorite Things</em>` and even messed around with it. I have to admit how fun and refreshing it was to get back to playing again. Its really nice that we have a piano in the house. I had a lot of fun playing in the past and although I need to brush up on reading sheet music again, I don't think getting back into the loop will be that difficult.
