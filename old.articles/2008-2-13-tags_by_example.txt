Disclaimer: I work on del.icio.us, but that doesn't mean that they endorse a specific way to tag or organize your data. Your data is just that, your own. Everyone is different.

Through my work on del.icio.us and other 2.0-ish products I've seen many different people use tags in many different ways. Through this I've come up with a few steps that I use to better organize my thoughts with whatever tool or site supports tags.

The purpose of doing it this way is to make it easier to recall what I want. Lets say that I work on a project about ruby on rails for 3 months and then move to working on c++. If in 6-10 months I want to look something up involving ruby that I likely looked at while working on it the first time I just have to ask myself these questions to get the tags/terms use in my query.

When I'm about to tag something I start off with a few simple questions.

*   What type of thing is this?
*   What are at least 3 things that describe it?
*   Where is it?
*   Where will it be worked on?
*   Where will it be completed?
*   What is its priority?
*   I will complete/do this with [tag].
*   What needs to be done to complete/do this?
*   What tools will be used?
*   Who is involved?
*   Who is this for?
*   Where did I learn about it?

Those questions can be applied to a number of things, but not all of them may apply to any particular thing. Some are better suited when organizing tasks, others for arbitrary content via urls/websites.

Example task: Call Charlie and wish him a happy birthday

*   What type of thing is it: task
*   What are at least 3 things that describe it? birthday, family, event
*   Where will it be worked on? home
*   What is its priority? high
*   I will complete/do this with [a] phone call.
*   Who is involved? charles gerakines

Final result: task, birthday, family, event, home, priority:high, phone call, charles gerakines

*   What type of thing is this? bookmark
*   What are at least 3 things that describe it? erlang, guide, cheatsheet
*   Where is it? devmobile
*   Where did I learn about it? via:markz

Final result: bookmark, erlang, guide, cheatsheet, devmobile, via:markz
