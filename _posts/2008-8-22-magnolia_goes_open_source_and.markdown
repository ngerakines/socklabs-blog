    Ma.gnolia goes open source and uses GitHub
---

Woke up this morning to find a few articles scattered around the web about the social bookmarking site Ma.gnolia going open source. Ma.gnolia has been around for a while but never really took off like Delicious did. There are a lot of opinions as to why and how, but that really isn't the point of this post.

I see some similarities between Ma.gnolia and Reddit (except that Reddit scores much higher on the AWESOME scale) with a move like this. With OpenID and OAuth support as well as an Open Social-based API, this is an interesting move. Web software packages like Reddit, Ma.gnolia and Identi.ca are starting to become the norm in decentralized web services.

I'm excited to see that there are already some big players in the roll-your-own-service field. I think as time goes on we'll see more and more companies find value in doing things this way. It is good for the company, good for the industry and good for the developers.

I'm also really excited to see that Ma.gnolia decided to use GitHub as a deployment medium. When the code is actually available (I have not seen a real release date yet) it will be fork time.
