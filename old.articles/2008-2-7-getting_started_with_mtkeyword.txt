    Getting started with MT-KeywordExtractor (ftp)
---

Plugin installation can sometimes be confusing especially when the plugins grow more and more complex. This is a very guide to installing the plugin MT-KeywordExtractor and getting it started.

This version assumes you have ftp access to your blog. Please also keep in mind that I am a Linux/Mac guy so these instructions will be biased.

Download the lastest version of MT-Keyword extractor. Currently the most recent version is 0.6, so the url to download it is <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/wp-content/KeywordExtractor-0.6.tgz">http://blog.socklabs.com/wp-content/KeywordExtractor-0.6.tgz</a>.

Once you have it downloaded unarchive it with your favorite unarchiving program or use the terminal: <code>tar zxvf KeywordExtractor-0.6.tgz</code>.

Next open your favorite FTP client and manuver to your MT installation directory and to the plugins folder. Upload the entire folder that was unarchived to plugins directory.

This plugin does not require any other steps to be taken to get it working. You should be able to see the plugin in the plugin settings page.
