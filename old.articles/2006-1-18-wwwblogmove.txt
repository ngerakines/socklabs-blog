Over the past few nights I've been working on a module to assist in migrating my blog from one CMS to another. The module has come along very well and I think it is ready for a first release. It works by using xmlrpc calls to migrate all of the content from one blog to another. This way there are no plugins to keep track of or hassle on the user side of things.
