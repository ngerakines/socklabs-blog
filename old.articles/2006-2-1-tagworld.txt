A friend had a link to <a href="http://tagworld.com/">TagWorld</a> and I checked it out. In a nutshell TagWorld is a myspace clone but marketed toward the non-prostitot subculture that myspace has. I <a href="http://tagworld.com/ngerakines">created an account</a> for what its worth.

It'll be fun to track its growth and see where it is in a month and then in 6 months.
