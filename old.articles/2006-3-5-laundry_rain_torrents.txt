    Laundry, rain, torrents
---

Its raining outside. Pretty hard at the moment. I'm at a laundromat on Market street that is open until midnight. Carolyn opens in the morning and has to be awake at 4:00 am so I'm washing work clothes for the two of us. When I get home I have to do some cleaning because Suzie is going to be showing the apartment to people.

Tonight Carolyn and I went down to Mountain View and had dinner with Mike and Karen. It went really well and I'm starting to enjoy meeting with them every so often. I wonder what things will be like when we live closer?

On that note I havn't really told many people, but Carolyn and I have decided to move to Mountain View instead of staying in the city. I was really hesitant about it at first because I really love living in San Francisco, but she said the words "<em>I really want to be closer to my family</em>" and there wasn't any more question. I think in the upcoming months having the support system of family and friends in place is going to be more important than I think.

I work very close to the CalTrain station anyway, and the main place we have in mind is right on one of the bullet stops. Since I will be commuting to the city every day, at least I'll be able to be comfortable on the train and hack or listen to music. All things considered, I really believe it will be for the best.

The next few weeks are going to be very busy for both Carolyn and myself. She opens near every morning this week. At SixApart we've got a lot planned. Then on Friday Carolyn and I are flying down to Los Angeles and will be staying with Eric and Vicki for the night. Saturday we are going to pack the storage unit that I have in Los Angeles, get the GrandAm and drive up. Oyi.

Right now, I just want to walk home and not get wet.
