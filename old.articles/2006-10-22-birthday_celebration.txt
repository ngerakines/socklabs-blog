    Birthday Celebration

Ok, so it wasn't a big bash, but it will never be forgotten. This afternoon Carolyn's mom came over and babysat for an hour or two while Carolyn went out to have dinner. Having a little time for just the two of us, even if it wasn't for very long, really meant a lot. It was nice.

Before we left for dinner we opened gifts and I was shocked. Not only did I get a kick-ass Macbook Pro but I got a really really nice tea pot set from Teavana. I can't find the words to say how grateful I am. I was completely surprised.
