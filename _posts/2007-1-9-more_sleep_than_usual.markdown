    More sleep than usual
---

Last night we got back from a short walk (we almost got ran over by a senior citizen, more on that later) and was feeling kind of off. I fell asleep on the couch around 9:00 pm and moved to the bed about 9:30 pm. Although I woke up a few times I slept until 9:00 am (strait through my 8:00 am alarm). This morning was a little hazy but I feel much better.
