Yesterday the splashblog guys gave me a hand-me-down lifedrive to play around with. Its one of the few palm devices that has true wifi support and it is ideal for sending full and hires images from my camera to my TypePad blog. I'm having a lot of fun with it so far, but I'm trying very hard not to get attached as one day I'll have to give it back.

Jame's Snell's feed thread spec was accepted by the IETF recently. Congratulations. I'm looking forward to using it more in the near future.

See my blog post on the Fence Project Blog for more information as to where Fence is at and where it is going.

For the curious, I've got a Facebook account. I'm trying to move as far away from MySpace as possible, so if you have an account as well you should friend me.

Picked up two new Bokken and started practicing Iaido again. I wish I could find a dojo in the area, but the best I can find is an Aikido teaching center. I wonder if anyone in the area would give private lessons? Is there even a way to find a service like that?

Although I have been using Vox an awful lot lately, I will NOT forget or abandon my this blog.

Looking forward to dinner tonight with Carolyn and a friend of hers. I think we are going to make Beginets tonight for desert.

My Birkenstocks are starting to fall apart, I need to shoe shopping.
