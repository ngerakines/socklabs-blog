		 	<p>I've been on vacation in the city of New Orleans for almost a week now. It's been an amazing and very memorable time with Carolyn and Vanessa spending time with friends and family. We've been staying in the French Quarter right at Royal and St. Louie, right in the heart of New Orleans' historic district.</p>

<p>The last time I was here was just a few months after hurricane Katrina in December of 2005. At that time Carolyn and I did a drive through of New Orleans and took photos of the old houses that I lived in at one point or another. All of those photos can be found in the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sock/sets/1600186/">New Orleans December 2005</a> photo set that was posted to Flickr at the time. At the time we also stayed with Brent off of Dauphine and Toulouse in the French Quarter.</p>

<p>Three years later, Carolyn, Vanessa and I did the same tour with some surprising results. The houses we visited were Phosphor Ave and Veterans Blvd, Marshall Foch St and Robert E Lee Blvd, Prentiss Ave &amp; Pasteur Blvd and lastly Gentilly Blvd &amp; Derby Pl.</p>

<p>The house on Phosphor Ave was relatively untouched and had very little change. We weren't in that one very long, but I remember it well and had some friends in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The house on Marshall Foch had taking a real beating, much like the rest of that area. I had a lot of really fond memories of that neighborhood and riding my bike to the local stores, doing yard work for a few of the people we know and going to the lake front often.</p>

<p>Four months after Katrina it looked like this:</p>

<p>Now, three years later it looks like this:</p>

<p>The next house on the list was my grandmother's house on Gentilly Blvd. We lived with her off and on throughout my childhood and I really loved that house. We spent many summers playing in her yard and in her pool. It was great. This is also the house where I knew my grandfather although I was  young when he died. This house had taken some damage but it looked like it was in good shape.</p>

<p>I was really happy to see that the owners put a lot of work into building it back up. Now, it looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock/2943511918/" title="IMG_3375 by nickgerakines, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2943511918_8b136b3c0c.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_3375" /></a></p>

<p>The first house that I remember was at Prentiss Ave and Pasteur Blvd. This is the house that I really felt like I grew up in. I've got memories of running across the house from my bedroom into mom and dad's bed in the middle of the night. I remember getting up at 5 in the morning and doing mouser-cise. I remember learning to ride a bike and playing across the street with Heather and Evelyn. This house really means a lot to me. I was really sad to see it's condition.</p>

<p>Four months after Katrina it looked like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock/74549446/" title="Untitled by nickgerakines, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/42/74549446_3f0715f297.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>When we drove to the same place nearly three years later my heart sank a little. What this picture doesn't show is what the entire lot looks like. The house has been completely left to neglect and decay. There are entire shrubs growing through the floor and out of the windows from within the house. The pecan tree has been cut down and the entire place has been let go.</p>
