    Going mobile
---

I've been convinced that getting a mobile phone will make my life better in some way. Details on how have yet to be disclosed and I'll let the world world know as soon as I get them. In the mean time, I went to the cigular store today and got a very basic plan. The phone that I chose was the Nokia 6682.
