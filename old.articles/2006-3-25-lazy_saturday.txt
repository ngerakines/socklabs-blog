    Lazy Saturday
---

I woke up late on this lazy Saturday and everything just felt <em>right</em>. Last night I stayed up late <em>reading</em> of all thing and then crawled into bed and the warm of Carolyn put me to sleep right away.

A few days ago Carolyn and I went to the Borders book store on King street and got about a dozen books. I don't remember all the books that she got, but I do know that one of them was the Tucker Max book. I got 3 books in particular: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810930765/">Babar's Yoga for Elephants</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060899190/">PostSecret : Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives</a>, and lastly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765341425/">To Light A Candle (Obsidian Trilogy)</a>.

I've been steadily reading <em>To Light a Candle</em> as much as possible. I've always been a very big fan of Mercedes Lackey and have nearly all of her original books. Some of the new ones she's written and helped written I can't say that I'm a huge fan of, but any of the <em>Mage Wars</em>, <em>Herald-Mage</em>, <em>Valdemar</em> or <em>Mage Storms</em> trilogies I would gladly ramble on about. I really look forward to finishing this book and continuing on to book 3 of the <em>Obsidian Trilogy</em>.

Its been really fun having an iSight. <a href="http://webcam.socklabs.com/">My webcam</a> has been getting a _huge_ amount of traffic and it is fun to see who is watching and where they are. Carolyn is even starting to not object to the idea. Last night I had the webcam on during Foo-Bar and for the most part everyone seemed to liked it.

The rain last night forced us to kick-off foobar a bit late but no one seemed to mind. For the past few weeks the downpour has been heavy. For me it kinda reminds me of home. Living in Los Angeles soo long almost made me forget what it is like to have it rain every so often. While some people are grumpy about the weather, I am soo excited and happy when it rains. And ooo it puts me to sleep so soundly.

Today I think Carolyn and I are going to head over to the east bay. I've not spent much time over there so a driving tour doesn't sound so bad. I think we are going to pick up dinner while we are over there.
