    Before you^H^H^HI buy

<p>I'm starting to think that before I buy anything I should really think about the long term affects. Now a-days its not just 'Can I afford it' but also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>store it</li>
<li>clean it</li>
<li>maintain it</li>
<li>repair it</li>
<li>upgrade it</li>
<li>protect it</li>
<li>replace it</li>
<li>power it</li>
</ul>
<p>And if the question isn't met in a satisfactory manor, I shouldn't get it. Usually, its perceived cost rises from "$x" to "$x now, plus $y later, plus z hours of my spare time, at $zz/hour". It’s amazing how few Shiny New Toys retain their appeal after this.</p>
