    MT-KeywordExtractor updates

This is just a small blurb about <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/keywordextractor/">MT-KeywordExtractor</a>. Version <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/keywordextractor/2006/04/02/release_06/">0.6 was released</a> and comes with some enhancements. Now you can select how you want it to affect your blog. This includes populating the entry keywords or adding a technorati tag block to the text (or <em>more text</em>).

I've also put up a <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/keywordextractor/2006/04/04/getting_started_with_mtkeyword/">small guide to getting started with MT-KeywordExtractor</a>. It covers installation of the plugin.
