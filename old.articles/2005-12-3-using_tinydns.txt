    Using TinyDNS
---

I had to setup a DNS server lately and decided to go with something different.  Instead of using the monolithic BIND, I decided to go with DJBDNS instead. I found that not only was it really easy to setup and use, but also configure later on. I'm pretty impressed with it, although the real test will come later when the dns server starts to get more traffic.
