    Facebook doesn't like Battlestar Galactica

I got a warning from Facebook that threatened account removal over the Battlestar Galactica page that I created.

The page didn't have any copyrighted content nor (to my knowledge) did it contain any hateful remarks or comments. I suspect that because it had well over 40k fans it got the attention of the networks and they sent Facebook a takedown notice.

I would of given the page to whomever wanted it. Doing it like this is pretty lame.
