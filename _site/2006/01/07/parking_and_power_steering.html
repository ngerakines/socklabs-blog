		 	<p>Carolyn and I are sitting on the couch with our powerbooks. She's playing <em>The Sims</em> and I'm blogging. We have the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/"><em>Dodgeball</em></a> playing in the background and I havn't laughed this hard in a while. Whats more funny is how we are both totally geeking out together.</p>

<p>It started this afternoon when she got her christmas present, a new 15 inch powerbook. When we got back to the house we both started downloading and updating. In the process I found some really cool apps that I'm going to start using too. The kicker was finding a way to suck down all of the music from our ipods into iTunes. What we found works, and works very well, is <a href="http://www.drewfindley.com/findleydesigns/ipodaccess/">iPod Access</a>. Between our 3 ipods we've got a good collection going.</p>

<p>I would go into detail as to what happened after the court hearing but my blog is emo enough. In a nutshell, Carolyn's dad has been acting very vindictive and mean and is going out of his way to make everyone's lives miserable. Even his own. Carolyn's phone is out of commission, and on that note if I gave anyone a 408 number ignore it and call my house # instead.</p>

<p>Today, in and of itself, was a great great day. Started good, ended better. I still can't get ahold of <a href="http://www.jamesgross.com/">James</a> to geek out with, but I have all weekend. I'm really looking forward to some possible developments.. yeah yeah, its lame to tease.</p>

<blockquote>You better check yo self before you wreck yo self .. Cos I'm bad for your health, I come real stealth</blockquote>


<p>Onn another note the HD on my desktop finally kicked. Lost a lot of music on that one, but thats life. At least we have the screen/TV for DVD-goodness.</p>

<p>And btw, Deltron 3030 rocks.</p>
