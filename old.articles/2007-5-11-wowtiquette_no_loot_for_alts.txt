    wowtiquette: No loot for alts
---

There is a really good article on <a href="http://www.wowinsider.com/">wowinsider</a> about <a href="http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/11/but-i-need-that-for-my-alt/">claiming drops for your alt/friend/guildie/girlfriend/etc</a> and I wanted to give my take. I've only come across the situation once where someone was in the group and they make a need/claim for a blue claiming that it was for his alt and that he absolutely needed it. Well no, thats not cool. Acting like a ninja but saying that its an upgrade is still acting like a ninja.

Rule of thumb: When you are in a group and an item drops for any character other than the immediate one you are playing, don't claim it. Its not ok to claim stuff that you won't/can't use immediately. Especially if other people also want or need it.

Side note: Its also not cool to make a claim for an item with the excuse that its an upgrade and win it then not use it.

Fortunately I've never seen it happen in <a href="http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#guild-info.xml?r=Medivh&n=Delicious">our guild</a>.
