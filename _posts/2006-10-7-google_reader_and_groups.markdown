    Google Reader and Groups
---

While I was at the hospital Google released and updated version of Google Reader and Google Groups. I use Reader quite a bit and organize about 75 feeds with it. I really like the new layout although it does feel a little javascript heavy. Even with a few gripes, it still beats everything else out there. The only thing that comes close is NetNewsWire.

The new Google Groups interface really rocks. It feels much cleaner and easier to navigate. I keep up with a few groups: perl.qa, alt.tv.lost, Google-Maps-API, perl.modules, alt.tv.comedy-central.daily-show, linux.gentoo.user, talk.origins, comp.lang.javascript, etc.

Thew new Google Groups layout is sweet. I'll be happy when it comes out of beta.
