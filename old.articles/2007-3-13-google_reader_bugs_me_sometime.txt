    Google Reader bugs me sometimes
---

Google Reader is a cool tool and it has a lot of things that I like, but something that really bugs me is how it is inconsistent between tags and folders. In some places it asks you to organize your feeds by assigning tags and lets you sift through your feeds by tags, in other places it asks you to assign a feed to a folder but allows you to put a single feed in multiple folders.

Hey Google Reader team, pick one or the other. If you really want to go all out and use tags than do it right. Stop making users use a dropdown list to select the tags they want and make tagging ad hoc. Maybe a tag cloud or something to remind them of the tags they use.
