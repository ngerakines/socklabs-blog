Its been a while since I've seen him and I really wanted to hang out before Vanessa was born. I had actually invited both Ben, the older brother, and Charlie but Ben didn't make it for some reason.

Charlie flew out on Wednesday a bit after noon-ish and Carolyn picked him up from the airport. That night we hung out a bit, got dinner and played laser tag. On Thursday, Carolyn and Charlie made it up to the city to do the tourist thing over at pier 39 and then later that night we made it to the Giants/Padres baseball game.

While we were out we did make it to the Tech museum in San Jose and then went over to a BBQ.

Saturday we had big plans to go to 'Raging Waters'. When we got there we purchased our tickets went in and the place was packed. I honestly thought it was past its maximum occupancy. There was no place to sit, no place to stand, no shade or lockers. Luckily we were able to get our money back on the 30$ tickets and we went back to Carolyn's grandparent's house and went swimming. We all agreed that it was probably much more fun than dealing with the mess at the water park.

Over the course of his stay I helped him get used to OS X and how to user some of the basic applications. I think it will really stick with him. I was really glad to see him soo happy about it too. I think it is his first laptop, much less one he doesn't have to share.

Sunday morning came too soon. We woke up at 4:00 am and I brought him to San Jose and before I knew it, he was gone. I am sad, we had a really fun time.
