    Day 4 - Flea market shopping
---

We both decided that Sunday should include more relaxation that the first few, so because of that we didn't leave the french quarter. It worked out very nicely because it gave us time to check out the french market and do some walking around. A major influence was also that found a parking spot and didn't want to loose it. Its pretty tough to find one.

We watched lost, did some shopping, cleaned a bit and waited around for Brent. We also walked to the aquarium but found that it is going to be closed until late 2006. We were pretty bummed. Then we took a walk through the riverwalk mall.

It wasn't until nearly 10:00 pm that Brent showed up and convinced us to go out with him. We went to pirate's alley and met up with rafael. We didn't really go to sleep until nearly 3:00 am.
