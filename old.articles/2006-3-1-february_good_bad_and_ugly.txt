So Carolyn and I got married. Wow. AND we are going to have a child. WOW. I've never been happier.

Tom has officially been put on the shelf for a later date and time. Makes me real sad, but thats life.

Working at SixApart is going really well so far. I'm finally starting to get my hands dirty. It also felt really good to bring documentation and testing up to speed with the code base as a whole.

Started development of <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/cloudnine/">CloudNine</a> and <a href="http://libcaptcha.tigris.org/">libcaptcha</a>. Getting good feedback regarding cloudnine and released 3.0 which is stable and <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/cloudnine/2006/02/20/cloudnine-30/#c000098">future compatible</a>. libcaptcha is progressing and I've got a 'working' developer version going. It is in release 0.1 right now and still working out some kinks, but I'm very proud so far.

Playing a lot with <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype">MovableType</a> and seeing what it is capable of. Also looking at ways to make TypePad more community friendly. Lots of bug squashing and planning meetings going on.

Dinner just arrived, I'm going to go eat and then head home.
