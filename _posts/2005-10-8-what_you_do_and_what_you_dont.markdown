    What you do and what you don't, uh huh

Its well past friday and pushing into Saturday with every passing moment. <a href="http://carolyn.socklabs.com/">Carolyn</a> sent some music over my way and I've been having fun with it.

Today has been very productive at work. I've got several working models up and running that I'll be using in a presentation on Monday. There are still alot of things to work out, but I think that they are all within grasp. I'm very excited, I'm doing some things that I've never done before and they are challenging <b>and</b> fun. After work one of the new guys, Peter, and I went for food and coffee. Come to find out, he is the project lead and creator of <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage: a feed reader for Firefox</a>. We talked for quite a while, mostly on random stuff, but it was fun. I'm sure that he will bring an entire set of unique talents to the Feedster team.

Tomorrow looks to be good. Meeting some new people and having good food. Thats the plan at least. I need to get some sleep, I've got a lot to do ( laundry ) for tomorrow
