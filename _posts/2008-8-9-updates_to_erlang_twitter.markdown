    Updates to erlang_twitter
---

I've been on a real 3rd party client library kick lately. So far I've got Erlang modules for couchdb, the World of Warcraft Armory and Twitter on GitHub. I've also got libraries for Delicious, Last.FM and an improved Facebook library in development, soon to be released.

The changes to erlang\_twitter include an overhaul of the gen\_server behavior being used. Now clients support multiple accounts, throttling and Identi.ca.
