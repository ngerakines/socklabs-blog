    More CPAN

The past few days have been very productive. I've released 3 modules, two of which are new. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Apache2-Mogile-Dispatch/">Apache2-Mogile-Dispatch</a> 0.2.1 has been released and is packed full of major changes in architecture and functionality. 

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/WWW-RobotRules-Memcache/">WWW::RobotRules::Memcache</a> is a new module that allows you to use memcached to store robot rule information. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Apache-No404Proxy-Mogile/">Apache::No404::Mogile</a>, an extension of Tastuhiko Miyagawa's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/Apache-No404Proxy">Apache::No404Proxy</a>is another new addition that lets you fallback to mogileFS when a file can't be found on a web server by regular means.

In the skunkworks is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Apache2-SiteMap/">Apache2::SiteMap</a> which lets you dynamically create a Google SiteMap in the same fashion as mod_dir.
