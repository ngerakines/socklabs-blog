    5 Week And A Half Weeks!

Carolyn and I received some wonderful news recently. Carolyn and I found out that we will be having a baby. Its still very early and a lot can and probably will happen between now and early October, but we are soo very excited and happy.

I really can't begin to describe how happy, excited and scared I am. We've got a very strong support system of open and like minded friends and family who we know we can count on. The all around feel has been good and, if I may say so myself, we've got a very positive and optimistic attitude.

I really feel like this is going perfectly. Albeit a huge surprise and shock to us both, it couldn't of gone better. I know that this is going to be life altering in ways that I can't even think of right now and I'm glad that I couldn't of found a better person to go through it with.

Thank you everyone for your support and thoughts.
