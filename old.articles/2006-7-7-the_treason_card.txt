    The Treason Card
---

Sinclair Lewis, a nobel prize winner and all around good guy, was completely correct when he said "When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross."

Krugman has a fine piece out now called The Treason Card. He nails it very nicely, exposing what has been a campaign of intimidation and destruction of law with a masterly directness. Nothing quite makes the point like saying what you mean very clearly and without artifice. If you don't have access to the Times, the piece is reprinted here.

Recently there has been a flamewar in between the New York Times and the wall street journal. Paul Krugman wrote an excellent and thought provoking essay titled The Treason Card about the Bush administration's "authoritarian project", a campaign of intimidation and destruction of the law.

It all started when the wall street journal declared that the New York Times had treasonous intentions. That it "has as a major goal not winning the war on terror but obstructing it" — The Journal's own political editor pronounced himself "shocked," saying that "I don't know anybody on the news staff of The Wall Street Journal that believes that."

Either get the paper, go to the library or <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/%22the%20treason%20card%22">search 'the treason card'</a> because this is definitely worth the read.
