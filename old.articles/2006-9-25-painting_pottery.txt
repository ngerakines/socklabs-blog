Saturday evening we went over to Aqui in Willow Glen. For what they cost, they have excellent food. The last time I was there was with Carolyn and Jonathan a few months back.

After dinner we went over to <a href="http://www.petroglyph.com/willow.htm">Petroglyph</a> across the street. We looked around and found a piece that we wanted to work on then started at it. Carolyn made a food bowl for Picasso and I made a starry cookie jar.

Now I'm on the train and we just stopped at Redwood City and I ran into hachi. More blogging later
