    Bookmarks.com Launch Announcement
---

As everyone is quite aware we have been very busy working on various projects and aspects of Oversee.Net. I am proud to announce another addition to our lineage of products, Bookmarks.Com (http://bookmarks.com/).

Bookmarks.com was started in April by Eric Gradman and Myself with a commission from Lawrence to create something that we could use in our daily lives. We feel that we've done just that. Bookmarks.com is a project that allows visitors and users to create a web based front end to all of their bookmarks and web links. Registered users can add new bookmarks and tag them accordingly and then have access to a wealth of information based on what they, and other users, have put into the system.

This site was launched on Wednesday in a beta mode and is steadily growing. Its current features include a native XML/XSL transformation layer and the ability to render xhtml, rss feeds, xbel formats and atom feeds.

This is really only the beginning though. In the skunkworks we have alot planned for this project. Eric Gradman is currently working on import and export functionality for delicious user and XML feeds. We also have several 3rd party applications that allow you to manage your bookmarks through your desktop or firefox browser. In addition, the site will soon allow complex custom filters and the ability to search through content. I strongly encourage everyone to create an account and play around, and keep posted for updates and changes.

Currently we are in need of a few things. The user interface, aka templates, could use a good bit of work. Also there really lacks documentation and information, such as about pages, company information, etc. If you would like to volunteer some of your time please contact me about it.

Thanks to Eric Gradman and Amanda McConnell for there valuable input and time.
