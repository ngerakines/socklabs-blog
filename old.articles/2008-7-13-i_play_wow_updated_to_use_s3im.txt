    I Play WoW updated to use s3images
---

I'm happy to announce that the image gallery on [I Play WoW](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2359644980) is completely powered by the [s3images](https://github.com/ngerakines/s3imagehost/tree) project as is with no modifications. For a long time, users have complained that the image gallery feature in I Play WoW was weak and that they really didn't like that it was tied into their Facebook image galleries.

A few days ago I started the s3images project to create an open source application that allows website developers to store and serve images and files using the Amazon S3 service.
