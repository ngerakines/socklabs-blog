		 	<p><em>Deep breath</em> ahh, its raining again. I really do consider it one of the simpler pleasures in life.</p>

<p>Past few days have been very nice. Work is going very well and I am satisfied. I think I really do get the hang of how everything works and it is all really moving along. Today I had lunch with Michael over at <a href="http://www.slide.com/">Slide.com</a> and gave him Amanda's camera to return to her this weekend. He's a very cool guy. I'm eager to get the mac client for slide, I've got a lot of pictures to get out there.</p>

<p>Today I got 8 rolls of film that I've been somehow collecting over the past few years developed. I've got a ton of pictures now dating back to 2003. It put me in a pensive and reflective mood with the lapse back in time. Hmm.</p>

<p>A few nights ago I got to have dinner with Noel and his wife. I really enjoyed that. He is a very cool guy. Hopefully we can pull Yeves over more often as well. On Wednesday I went to the dinner and meeting at the Scottish Rite hall. Very interesting and informative. I think it'll be a worthy endeavor. Monday and Tuesday were fairly plain, and I like it that way.</p>

<p>No big plans this weekend. <a href="http://carolyn.socklabs.com/">Carolyn</a> and I are going out on Saturday and then Sunday I'm going to hang out and try to widen the social circle a bit.</p>

<p>No plans next week. Rolling out some cool stuff at <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a> and really looking forward to it. Might meet up with some new people too.</p>
