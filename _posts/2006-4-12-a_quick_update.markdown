    A quick update
---

In some cases, not all of them, it holds true that the less frequent a usually frequent blogger blogs, the more is going on in the real world. This is true for Carolyn and me. The past 2 weeks have been crazy busy and I finally have a few moments to write about it.

The biggest news it that Carolyn and I found a nice apartment in Mountain View and went for it. We saw this one about 2 weeks ago but didn't act on it immediately, but in the end it was perfect for us.

It takes right about 4 minutes to walk to the CalTrain station and has plenty of space to grow into. Its very different from our old apartment in a lot of ways so I won't even bother trying to compare the two. It would be like comparing the internet to the 405 freeway.

The place is pretty empty right now. I don't have a lot of stuff and have always been told that I live like a monk in that regard. Carolyn and I made a trip to IKEA and got some furniture and other essentials though.

This past weekend was a hackstorm as Scott and DK pounded through code. It was really productive and nice to hang out. There is no doubt that <a href="http://www.ookles.com/">it</a> is really going to fly past expectations.

Most of Sunday was spent in Mountain View and San Jose. We went through paperwork on the apartment and signed some things. At some point during the paperwork I started to feel really sick and havn't quite shaken it. After that was all said and done, we went over to her dad's house and had dinner with Mike and Karen.

Monday and Tuesday were a bit of a blur because of a really bad stomach bug. I say bug with good intentions of it going away really soon. I went in on Tuesday thinking I could just 'walk it off' but by 1:30 or so I had to run to the bathroom and took it as a sign.

Things are going really well and Carolyn and I feel really good. Now that I think about it, I havn't had any coffee/soda since Sunday.

Yesterday Carolyn woke me up at about 4:00 pm and we went down to Moutain View with a carload of stuff for the new apartment. We did laundry at her dad's house and rolled out the aero-bed and conked out from a long day. It was our first night in our new place together and we couldn't of slept better.
