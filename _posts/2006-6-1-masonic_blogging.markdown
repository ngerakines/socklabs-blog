Recently at Lodge, I've been tentatively put in charge of the website and publication of the Trestle Board. Being one who enjoys a good challenge, I've taken seriously the idea of redesigning the Lodge website. I've been playing with a variety of ideas, blogging/content systems, themes and layouts to come up with something that will appeal to the members.

Ideally I would love to have Grand Lodge work with TypePad to setup a California Freemason Portal and allow brothers and lodges to have blog style websites. Until then, I'm happy to setup an iWeb or MT website for our lodge to take advantage of.

I've got a demo site up and would love some feedback.
