Last week we found out that there is a very high possiblity that Melee has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_infectious_peritonitis">FIP </a>and we may have to put him to sleep. Since we found out it just doesn't feel the same when we play with him. It is very sad and we are both unhappy to bear the bad news.

<a href="http://charlie.vox.com/">Charlie</a> and <a href="http://ben-g.vox.com/">Ben</a> both seem to be doing well and have been blogging every now and then. I'm trying to strongly encourage them to continue and post more often, but I can only do so much before I become an annoyance. <a href="http://carolyn.vox.com/">Carolyn</a> has also been blogging, quite a bit actually, and it has made me very very happy. Honestly we've worked out a deal that is ideal for both of us. Maybe she'll post about it some time. I've been passing out quite a few Vox invitations and I'm really glad to see that more and more of my friends and family are using it.

And on Carolyn, the baby shower is quietly creeping up on us. I was pleased to find out that the invitations had actually been sent and people were receiving them. I'm not expecting a huge turn out, but I don't think that it is a bad thing, it being a co-ed party and all.

I'm also happy that the weather is starting to get a bit cooler. The past few months have seen record breaking heat and we've been miserable. At its height it was measuring in the 110's.

The tech world hasn't been short on excitement either. SixApart was in full force at OSCON and a lot of good came from it. I heard that <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">Anil</a>'s presentation was taken well and over all I think we had 6 people from SixApart presenting in one way or another.

Google also announced its <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">code hosting service</a> for open source projects. I've got a few thoughts on this and what they really want to do with it. I get the impression that they aren't actually going for code hosting so much, but a project directory. It is extremely easy to setup a project but actually host the code and management software somewhere else. I wonder if they will get into actual code parsing and search? Food for though.

And on the subject of Google, I've been using more and more of it. A while ago I got an invite to test Gmail for domains and moved gerakines.net mail handling over to it. I've been happy with the service so far and hope that its only just the tip of the iceberg. I've thought for a while that the email/hosting market is heavily saturated while still being difficult to use and manage. I hope that Google decides to change that. With that in mind I've also been toying around with Calendar, Groups and Reader. I have a new found respect for the Calendar application, it has probably become my favorite of all of the Google services.

WWDC kicked off this morning with a mild keynote by Steve Jobs. I describe it as mild because it felt more like what could be considered a 'maintenance release' as opposed to the ooohs and aaaahs of what he normally presents. I'm really looking forward to OS 10.5 and the new features that it will bring to iChat and Finder. I will still, however, gripe that iPhoto and Mail lack real organizational tools like folksonomies and the like. The highlight for me: Seeing spotlight search across multiple computers.

At work we've been busy preparing for a seismic release. I've been writing lots of test code while the rest of the team has been crunching away at getting things ready and complete. The next few months are going to be a lot of fun as some of the older projects near completion and the newer ones start to come in focus.
