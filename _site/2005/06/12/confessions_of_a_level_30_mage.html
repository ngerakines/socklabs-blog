		 	<p>Recently on Windrunner my main character Swiftburn broke level 30. The past few days in game have been pretty fun. My character is high enough to actually start exploring places on his own and to get into some of the larger instances and raids. Henrydarger, Corey's character, has been a huge help with some of the quests that I just can't do on my own.</p>

<p>So far I've got all of Duskwood completed now and started on some interesting quests near South Shore. Corey and I also took a peek into Gnomeregan but got our asses kicked pretty badly and called it a night. I also killed my first bunch of undead today near South Shore. They were few undead characters around my level and it was pretty fun.</p>

<p>Lastly I'd like to mention that I joined a new guild because the one that I was in disbanded. I don't really know why exactly but I think the guild leader wanted to merge with a larger guild. It kinda sucks but what can you do. I'm in another guild for now but Corey, Sterling and I all want to create our own. That might happen pretty soon.</p>
