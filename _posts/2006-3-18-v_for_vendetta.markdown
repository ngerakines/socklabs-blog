Last night Carolyn and I caught a late showing of <em>V for Vendetta</em> at the metreon. I wasn't really sure if Carolyn would like it, but I had high hopes for it. After sitting through it I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies that I've seen all year. I was very impressed with the thoroughly developed plot and development of the characters. All around it was a really great movie.
