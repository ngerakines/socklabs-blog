At work the A/C system has been updated so the server room and programmer's cave is a constant 55° since monday. On another note Brent is on the west coast touring with his fencing company. He called me last night and said that he was at a Denny's in Santa Monica with his crew. I'm real excited that he'll be out here for my 21st birthday next week.
