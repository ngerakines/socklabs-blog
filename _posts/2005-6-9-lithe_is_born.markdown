For a while now I've been throwing together pieces and parts of a content management system focused toward blogs using some of the latest xml/xslt libraries. That project finally has a name and is going forward with development. I've decided to call it `<strong>lithe</strong>`.

I think the name lithe fits perfect with this project because of what it stands for. This project seeks to be implicitly simplistic and yet as flexible as one would expect a content management system to be.

For more information be sure to check out the <a href="http://lithe.socklabs.com/">project page</a>.

Currently I'm looking for other perl developers who would be interested in this project.
