    Of Flickr and Yahoo

<cite>Disclaimer: I work at Yahoo.</cite>

A few days ago I got an email from the Flickr team letting me know that the deadline to merge my Yahoo account and Flickr account is closing fast. Its been known for a while and I've been putting it off for one reason or another.

I finally did it and know how much it has affected me? Zilch. Zero. Nadda.

My Flickr username didn't change. None of the links to my photos changed. None of my content changed. None of my contacts changed. The way flickr contacts me has not changed. My groups have not changed. The comments I've made and received have not changed. None of my notes have changed. None of my tags have changed. All of my sets are the same. The site looks, acts and feels the same as it did 10 minutes before I merged my accounts. I'm a pro member and I will continue to be one.

Funny how the CEO of Zoomer, Thomas Hawk, wrote a trog post titled '<a href="http://thomashawk.com/2007/01/theres-some-mighty-pissed-off-flickr.html">There's Some Mighty Pissed Off Flickr Members Right Now</a>' and then submitted the same url to Digg titled '<a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Flickr_Users_Are_Mad_as_Hell_About_Today_s_Yahoo_News">Flickr Users Are Mad as Hell About Today's Yahoo News</a>'. What does he personally have to gain from Flickr moving forward and enabling its users to integrate with the other Yahoo products? <strong>Nothing</strong>, and he wants you to think that its your idea that its very bad and scary.

Thomas Hawk you are LAME and your propaganda is bullshit.
