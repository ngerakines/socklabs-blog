    A new obsession
---

Recently Carolyn and I have resurrected our old Neopets accounts. Now one would say that the idea of getting into that game is laughable, but I wouldn't totally shrug it off as it does have some really nice qualities.

I've got two pets, Smunson and Aaudi, but she has 4 and I don't know the names. I've had my account since 2000 when I met one of the developers in a forum who was asking for help with some application modeling. Thats how I was introduced to the game.

The game has grown quite a bit since then and they have really expanded there operations. I even got offered a job there in 2002 but I don't think I'll ever really want to have to work with php full time as a profession.

For those of you who have played before and still have an account, log back in and see what has changed. I think it would be possible to make a great case study of the advertising and revenue models they use and the markets they are going after.

Plus, in a weird and cheesy way its kinda fun.
