So Charlie is on a plane right now headed for the west coast. His flight arrives at 1:30 in San Jose, but Carolyn is the one picking him up from the airport. I was kinda bummed that I wouldn't be able to, but it'll be ok.

My plans for today are basic. At work I've been put in charge of creating the test suite for TypePad given the heavy work being done by Mark, Paul and Garth for Seismic. I think I'm also going to get a haircut at lunch and see if I have time to run to the apple store to pick up an extra power cord for the iBook.

I don't think we have anything set for tonight but it'll most likely start with dinner. We'll just wing it from there.
