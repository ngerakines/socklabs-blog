    Day 5 - Really weird sex
---

By the fifth day my cold was really beating at the door. Brent had officially asked us to pick up an air mattress so we did that and also went to the lakeside shopping center too. Nothing big or anything, but walked around and `hung out` at the mall. After that we went to starbucks to try to go online but I ended up just watching lost because the internet connection was crap.

The night ended with us crashing out pretty hard. Nothing big or special happened.
