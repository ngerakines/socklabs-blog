    Looking better

I've talked to both Brent and Emily whom both gave me a list of people they new that were ok after the storm. Brent is on his way to Houston TX and Emily is in Covington with her mom and extended family. I also heard from Lance, Toni, Courtney and a few others that were with them. The only people who I havn't heard form is Aaron and I'm pretty worried. I feel a bit better after talking to them but there are still thousands missing and unaccounted for.
