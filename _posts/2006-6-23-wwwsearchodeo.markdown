Last night I put out another module to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/">CPAN</a>: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/WWW-Search-Odeo/">WWW::Search::Odeo</a>. About a year and a half ago I started writing WWW::Search::* modules whenever I found a site with search functionality that didn't have one already. This is just a continuation of that practice.

The code repository can be found here: <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/svn/WWW-Search-Odeo/">http://code.sixapart.com/svn/WWW-Search-Odeo/</a>
