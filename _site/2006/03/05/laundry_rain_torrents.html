		 	<p>Its raining outside. Pretty hard at the moment. I'm at a laundromat on Market street that is open until midnight. Carolyn opens in the morning and has to be awake at 4:00 am so I'm washing work clothes for the two of us. When I get home I have to do some cleaning because Suzie is going to be showing the apartment to people.</p>

<p>Tonight Carolyn and I went down to Mountain View and had dinner with Mike and Karen. It went really well and I'm starting to enjoy meeting with them every so often. I wonder what things will be like when we live closer?</p>

<p>On that note I havn't really told many people, but Carolyn and I have decided to move to Mountain View instead of staying in the city. I was really hesitant about it at first because I really love living in San Francisco, but she said the words "<em>I really want to be closer to my family</em>" and there wasn't any more question. I think in the upcoming months having the support system of family and friends in place is going to be more important than I think.</p>

<p>I work very close to the CalTrain station anyway, and the main place we have in mind is right on one of the bullet stops. Since I will be commuting to the city every day, at least I'll be able to be comfortable on the train and hack or listen to music. All things considered, I really believe it will be for the best.</p>

<p>The next few weeks are going to be very busy for both Carolyn and myself. She opens near every morning this week. At SixApart we've got a lot planned. Then on Friday Carolyn and I are flying down to Los Angeles and will be staying with Eric and Vicki for the night. Saturday we are going to pack the storage unit that I have in Los Angeles, get the GrandAm and drive up. Oyi.</p>

<p>Right now, I just want to walk home and not get wet.</p>
