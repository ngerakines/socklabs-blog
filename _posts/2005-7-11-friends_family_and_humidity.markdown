    Friends, Family and Humidity

I think my recent adventures to New Orleans did me alot of good. I won't say that I had one huge reason in particular for me to make it, however there were alot of medium factors that added up. This will try to be a day by day account of everything that happened and didn't happen.

Keep in mind that right now i'm typing this from this clunky airport internet kiosk while waiting on my flight to vegas. Its pretty hot right now but at least they keep the A/C going inside and the humidity is pretty down. My flight looks to be pretty full but for better or worse I'm pretty awake and I have a few magazines to keep me busy.

As soon as I get the chance, I'll post the near 200 pictures that I've taken in and around New Orleans, Hammond and Covington.
