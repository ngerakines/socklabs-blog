<p>As Les has <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2007/09/20/its-so-quiet-time-for-an-editorial-calendar">said</a>, like so many others: I've been so busy ... No time to blog ... I promise that I will soon ... Will set time aside to do so ... blarg. I'd like to think that I will blog more often but with <a href="http://preview.delicious.com/">sooo</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Application-Development-N-Gerakines/dp/0470246669/">much</a> <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/iplaywow/">stuff</a> going on, I doubt that things will pick up in the near future.</p>

<p>This is more of a "Hey! I'm alive!" post. There are a lot of things that I would <strong>like</strong> to blog about, some of them more important than others.</p><p><ul id="undefined"><li>Vanessa turned one! The special event took place at Chuck E. Cheese and we had a great time. Sooner or later there will be another post on dadhood much like this one with an update on Vanessa.</li><li>Carolyn had her 20th birthday. There are a few pictures floating around of the event.</li><li>We've been busting ass to push the 2.0 release of Delicious. The preview is up and available, if you havn't seen it you should check it out and request an invite.</li><li>The mustang is finally out of the shop. It needs a paint job but it sure does purr like a kitten. Anyone interested? Its for sale.</li><li>Carolyn and I have both been 70 for a while, have our flying mounts and in general have been having a ton of fun on Medivh. We are both Kara keyed and several of the other members are as well. We are thinking about doing a social raid once a week to get things going. So far so good.</li></ul></p>
