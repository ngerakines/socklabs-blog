    Site cleanup

I've taken on the task of doing some tag upkeep throughout the site. This is mostly composed of tagging older entries that were neglected in some shape or form. You'll start to see a much more matured tag cloud and weight throughout the site though.

I'm also looking for new ways to create a site flow or process without using archives. This would preferably be tag/folksonomy based. Any ideas?
