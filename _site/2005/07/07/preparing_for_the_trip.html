		 	<p>Things have been quite busy lately while I prepare for my extended weekend in New Orleans. Its looking like I'll be spending most of my time with Emily and Aaron but I'm really happy about seeing Brent and my Grandmothr as well. I only have 3 days, which I should of tried extending, but I think I can cover all of the basics in that time.

Yesterday turned out to be a great day. I've officially been put in charge of development for Information.com and have alot of very cool ideas that I want to start implimenting. First and foremost is a code cleanup though. There is a memory leak somewhere and it needs to be caught and fixed before anything new is added. Its my opinion, along with several other key people, that integration of <a href="http://www.information.com" target="_self">Information.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bookmarks.com" target="_self">Bookmarks.com</a> is essential. I'm still working out the details on implimentation but I think we are going to open a more extensive xmlrpc layer for server to server communications. That'll also really help open the public API and bring us closer to a unified login and toolkit.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm very excited about all that is going on at work.</p>

<p>I've also been thuroughly enjoying my mustang. I'm very pleased to say that I've had no issues in any way with it. Don't get me wrong, I need to replace a few parts and pieces, but most of the items on the to do list are cosmetic. Sooner or later I'll get some pictures up and posted for general consumption.</p>

<p>My cousins Jamie and Tiffany also fly in from Australia today. Its unfortunate that I won't be able to pick them up, but we've worked something out for them. Before they left for the trip we had made plans to see the production of <em>Wicked</em> at the Pantagas tonight at 8:00 pm. I'm really looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to continue working on a Bayes filtering system for Bookmarks.com that I started last night. Around 2:00 am I woke up and came up with a pretty cool way to moderate bookmarks and prevent abuse. We'll see how it all goes. Also need to print out the mass of paperwork that I need in preparation for my flight and all. Otherwise, I'm also going to get with James and help him finalize the website that I'm hosting for him. Check out Jinsai.net.</p>
