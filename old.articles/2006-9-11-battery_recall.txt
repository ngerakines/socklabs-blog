    Battery Recall
---

This morning I filled out the form to have my battery replaced by Apple. For a split second while checking the serial number I thought that I was one of the fortunate ones but alas mine is just as dangerous as the lot. I really hope that this will help and the heat difference will be noticeable.

Now that my battery is out and my machine is running on AC alone I'm kind of shocked as to just how heavy this sucker is. On a related note, I should be getting my <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/icurve/">iCurve</a> some time soon! I had one back at Feedster and absolutely loved it.
