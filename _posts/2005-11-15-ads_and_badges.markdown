The loyal readers out there ( now counting 3 total ) will see that there are several google ad blocks around the site. On the index and category pages I've added one to the side panel and the actual post pages have them directly underneath the post content. If you are bored, click on an ad and make me a few cents.

I'd also like to point out the flickr badge on the panel on the front page. It might still need some tweaking, I think the links are broken, but it is a pretty cool graphic to the recent posts to my flickr account.
