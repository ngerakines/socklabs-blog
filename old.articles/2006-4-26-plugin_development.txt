<a href="http://www.majordojo.com/">Byrne</a> wrote an awesome MovableType extension called <strong>Plugin Manager</strong>. To show that I think its an awesome and usefull tool, I've started converting all of my plugins to use the plugin format and standard that he's laid out.

Please check both of the plugin project blogs, <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/keywordextractor/">MT-KeywordExtractor</a> and <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/cloudnine/">CloudNine</a>, for updates and guides on how to use and install them.
