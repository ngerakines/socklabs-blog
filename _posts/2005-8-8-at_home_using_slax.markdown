    At home, using slax

My computer crapped out on my a little over a week ago. Hard drive finally gave out and died. Although this has horrible timing, it is inspiration to save up and get a new powerbook or IBM thinkpad. If I were to get a laptop, those would be the brands of choice. Until then, I'm stuck with a linux livecd.

Although I first thought that running a livecd would cut out all of the features that I'm used to, I am quite wrong. I'm running <a href="http://slax.linux-live.org/">slax</a>, a slackware based live cd. It picked up the nvidia card and everything right off the bat, however it does come with vim *boggle* and some of the other basics like firefox. Beggars can't be choosers.

This past weekend has been quite busy. I don't really know if I want to go into all of the details, but the output of all of this is that I'm quite tired and sore. Ontop of that, I decided to forsake soda, caffeine and candy starting last friday. So far so good, but I had a pretty killer headache for the better part of the day. I also got a haircut and changed the oil in the pontiac on Saturday while I was over in Orange.
