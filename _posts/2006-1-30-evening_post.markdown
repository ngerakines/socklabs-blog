I left my headphones at the house and was without music for the better part of the work day. For those who don't know me, music is a serious ingredient in all of my creativity. Maybe its just the rhythmic beats or patterns, but good music always gets me in the zone. Its almost hard to work without it.

Carolyn is making fun of me at the moment because of the facial expression I made at the thought of having some 'Nilla wafers. Mmmm, I love those things. I think that I'm coming down with a cold or something.

I'm making pretty good progress on the book <em>Snow Crash</em>. I was reading on the train to and from work today. Its getting really good. I'm a sucker for a good cyberpunk novel.

Last night I did some work on an rss feed parsing module for MT. The idea is to create a module that will let me sync articles in MT and urls ( from <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/">bookmarks.socklabs.com/</a>) that have matching tags. I'll hack at it some more and see where it goes.

Tonight Carolyn got a yahoo mail plus and is now one of the beta testers for the new webmail app. I'm kinda jealous, it looks very cool. I'm giving serious thought to either that or signing up for a .mac account.
