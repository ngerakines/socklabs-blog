Over the weekend I found a large cache of entries from 2002 through 2004. I've been slowly importing them one at a time and adding tags when possible. It sure is cool being able to go back and see what was going on then. There are quite a few gaps because of things like military basic training or just being too busy to blog, but there is a huge amount of content and I'm really glad that I ran across it.
