My macbook pro has been dangerously hot lately so I finally brought it into the apple store. Its been sent off to the repair depot and hopefully within 7-10 business days I'll get it back. I'm a little concerned about what will need to be replaced/fixed. The model that I have fell prey to a faulty heat-sink adhesive. Both of the fans are operating as expected but the machine was still reporting temperatures well over 200 degrees. Until then my internet access at home is severely limited.
