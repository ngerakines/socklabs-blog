    Visiting Google
---

Not too long ago I had the pleasure of visiting the googleplex in Mountain View, California for official business. I met some very interesting people and had a great time in the meetings and afterward chatting with some of the other attendees. Of course its all very top secret and hush hush, but I did manage to get a glance at <em>Google's Master Plan</em> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/21470089/">View</a>).

I think the most interesting piece at the HQ was a realtime display in the lobby of the searches performed around the world. It showed a 3D globe with colored streams of light bursting from points on this globe designating the density of searches performed and the language they were made in. It was amazing.
