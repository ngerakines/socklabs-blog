    Perl Modules
---

I wrote and submitted 2 new perl modules today. Both have been accepted and indexed, so go check them out.

The first is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-NameGen/">WWW::NameGen</a>. This module is a simple wrapper for a website that returns random names based on the US Census. It isn't anything super or special, but see the README file for more information.

The other module is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Yahoo-KeywordExtractor/">WWW:Yahoo::KeywordExtractor</a>. This module submits content to the keyword extractor API and returns a list of relevant keywords. I'm thinking of using it in a MovableType plugin that autogenerates tags for new blog entries.
