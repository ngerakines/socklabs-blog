TypePad development is moving along. I'm working on a lot of testing and documentation stuff which I find very fun. Working on a goal of 65% test coverage and I think it will be reached pretty soon.

Byrne sent over some new atom logos that look pretty sweet. I'd love to start
using and promoting them.

Last night there was some major issue with the muni metro lines. I got on the N line around 5:45 pm at the cal-train station and right as it was going into the embarcadaro tunnel it stopped and we sat there for about 2 hours. I ended up just getting off of the train at the powel station and walked home. There were a lot of very unhappy people last night. I was definitely one of them.

The only good thing that came out of being stuck on a train for 2 hours was that I got to write <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/wp-content/category_xmlrpc.pod">this document</a>. I've been tinkering with the idea of writing a spec doc to outline a set of xmlrpc calls that could be used to manipulate categories on blogs. The document is <em>DRAFT</em> and isn't completely ready yet but it is getting there. Questions and comments would be loved.

The train incident also killed v-day plans for Carolyn. We ended up exchanging some gifts and having a quiet dinner at 'Home' on the corner of church and market. It was really nice.

Over the past few days I've been working on updating the <a href="http://ab2foaf.sf.net">ab2foaf</a> cocoa application. I havn't done anything too fancy but have updated it to use the address book features new to 10.4. I'll repost the code and let the authors know about it. I'm also looking into creating apple scripts that do something similar. 

Today was car day. I had to take about 2 hours off of work to go down to the yard where they have Tom and deal with things. Tomorrow I go the the DMV and try to sort the rest out. Having a car is such a pain in the ass.
