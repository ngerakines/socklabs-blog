		 	<p>Past few days have been great. This morning I woke up and started to help clean up when I found a fat pigeon in the hall way. Something must of been wrong with it because it let me go right up to it and pet it a bit. Eventually I got a hand towel, wrapped it up safely and brought it outside where it could then take care of itself.</p>

<p>Last night was pretty exciting as well. Eric and Vicki had a formal wedding party in Beverly Hills that I attended. It was a lovely evening and I had the opportunity to meet the extended family as well as alot of the people they grew up with. It was a fun event and I'm looking forward to tonight when we meet back at the same place for a more roudy pool party. Congrats!</p>

<p>To everyone who has tried email me, I'm sorry. I think the phrase <code>&lt;em&gt;If its not broken, don't fix it&lt;/em&gt;</code> needs to be tatooed into my arm somehow because I had the strange notion that I needed to update the mail server. Its back up and running now, sorry about the troubles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> has been a tremendous assistance in trying to find a place to live up in San Francisco. I've probly sent out a good 2 dozen emails so far and still feel like I have quite a ways to go before I land something. The worst case scenario is that I'll live in a hotel for a week while trying to land something. Tyeson has already pledge that he'll drive up with me and help me move. Where would I be without him?</p>

<p>I'm going to miss alot of the people I've met at Oversee. I've made some great relationships and hope that the bonds that have been built, don't fade away any time soon.</p>

<p>In the little free time that I have I've been busy getting ready to push WWW::Bookmarks into an actual release. The bookmarks repo has been adjusted for contributed projects and WWW::Bookmarks and WWW::Search::Bookmarks have already been imported. What I'd like to do is create a source forge, savanah, or berlios project page for the entire thing and push it open source. Once I feel comfortable with Lithe I'll do the same with that. I'll also be looking for developers and contributors when that time comes.</p>
