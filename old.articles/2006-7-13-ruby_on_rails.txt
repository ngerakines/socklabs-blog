    Ruby on Rails

When Ruby on Rails became popular I didn't give it any thought. I've never been one to follow the slashdot crowd of cheering for the next big open source thing as if I don't have an opinion. The OSS community has started the belief that being tolerant means you can't be critical and that just isn't right. Anyway, that is an entirely different rant.

I've never seen any practical use of Rails. Perl has been around for years and has matured to the point that you can do nearly everything on it. Frameworks like Catalyst make it extremely easy to crank out MVC web-apps like its nobody's business. For that matter you could also do something similar with php and python.

Recently I started doing some ruby hacking and discovered how simple it is to get a rails driven web-app running. I'm just playing around at the moment, nothing terribly serious, but it sure is fun.

Maybe one of these days I'll post some snippets an things that I've come across.
