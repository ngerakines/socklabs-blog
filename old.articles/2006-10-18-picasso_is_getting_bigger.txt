    Picasso is getting bigger
---

Vanessa isn't the only one getting bigger around here ... Picasso is as well. I noticed this afternoon that he's become much more mellow and calm. He's also noticeably bigger and you can definitely see it when looking at him now and some of the pictures of him from a month or two ago.
