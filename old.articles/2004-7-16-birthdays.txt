    Birthdays
---

Its always easy to remember the birthdays of my friends because they are all within a month of each other. Susan, Chelsea, Brent, and Beverly to name a few. Don't know if I would really put Bev in the friend category though. Maybe its the valentine's day affect, who knows. My mom had her birthday the following day, wednesday, and I went over with a card and flowers. After talking to Susan on thursday and playing lots of Dance Dance Revolution she laughed and asked if it was a personal standard to always give flowers on birthdays. Anyway, that night I stayed there pretty late and then stopped by blockbuster for a few minutes on the way home.

Thursday was pretty eventful but not very productive. Was ready to head out and get some work done at starbucks, my second favorite place for programming on my laptop, when I stopped by Susan's to pick up my headphones. Well, that was around noon and I didn't get home until 3am. Figures really. We hung out, saw the movie Rainman, played DDR and talked. Had a good time, got a bit weird at times but wasn't bad still.

Today has been disappointing. No word from my boss or anything. No word from Andrew at GI-Trucking. Nothing else to do since I havn't heard from warchief. Today kinda sucks, I found ants in my room too. I really hate ants.
