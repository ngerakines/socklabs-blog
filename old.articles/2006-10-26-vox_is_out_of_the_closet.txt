    Vox is out of the closet

Well, sort of. <a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a> is now open to the public. I'm really excited for SixApart and the team that worked extremely hard to release a really great product. I'm <a href="http://ngerakines.vox.com/">excited about using Vox</a> not just as a blogging platform, but also a way to connect with my friends and family. If you havn't started using Vox yet ... You are missing out.
