    From Perl to C++
---

Since I transitioned to the backend team in Delicious I've been doing a lot of c++ development. It is definitely different than what I'm used to and the road from Perl to c++ isn't made of yellow bricks. It really requires thinking a bit differently, but its definitely not a bad thing.

I've been reading a lot about statistics and algorithms and even implemented a few myself. Can't go into too much detail but there are definitely a lot of really cool things in the skunkworks.

One of the cooler libraries that I've been using a lot is <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>. I <b>heart</b> boost.
