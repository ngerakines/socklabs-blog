    Missing the war
---

Was a productive day. I went into the office and got some work done while Carolyn went out shopping with a friend who is in town for the day. For the better part of the day was in that focused and single minded state of mind that programmers usually get into after focusing on the inner workings of logic for long periods of time. It was great.

Part of the playlist for this weekend:

<ul>
<li>Ben Folds Five - Missing the War</li>
<li>Victor Mallory - Boys Don't Cry</li>
<li>Hot Hot Heat - Middle Of Nowhere</li>
<li>Deltron 3030 - 3030</li>
<li>Johnny Cash - Man in Black</li>
<li>Polaris - Waiting for October</li>
<li>Daft Punk - Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</li>
</ul>

The weekend as a whole was pretty productive. This upcoming week looks good as well. Tomorrow night I'm meeting up with some fellow geeks at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=262+Church+St,+San+Francisco,+CA&btnG=Search&ll=37.766637,-122.428978&spn=0.005241,0.013497">muddys</a>. If you want to meet us there, we will be the cluster of geeks with laptops. I'll be the shaggy haired guy with my powerbook.
