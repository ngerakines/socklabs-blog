    Ding! Level 50
---

I hit level 50 about an hour ago and called it a night. Carolyn and I are thinking about heading out to Fry's or something. Its been sort of a long day and maybe going somewhere that isn't the office will do me some good. I've already updated my <a href="http://www.rupture.com/profile/993">rupture profile</a> for <a href="http://www.rupture.com/characters/US/Medivh/Korale">Korale</a> and everything is good to go.

I've also got a few extra rupture invites for guildies and close friends. Email me or contact me in game if you want one.
