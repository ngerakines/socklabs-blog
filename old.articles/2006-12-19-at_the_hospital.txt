    At the hospital
---

Its been a long day and I'm just happy that El Camino Hospital has free wifi in the ER. Carolyn is being seen right now but they told me that Vanessa isn't allowed to be with her and that I have to take her home because she can't be here. Well that is a carriage load of horse shit and I refuse to accept that so I'm waiting in the ER waiting room until I hear more.

It started as some abdominal pain last night and this morning when I was getting ready for work Carolyn told me that it was much worse so I stayed home today. We got to the emergency walk-in clinic and 9 hours later we are at El Camino hospital where Carolyn is getting a CT scan. At the clinic the doctor ruled out a lot and felt strongly that it could be appendicitis.

Its been a long day and the stress is starting to pile. I've got my concerns and fears but Carolyn is the center of all of it and I wish there was more that I could do for her. As soon as we found out that we'd have to come to El Camino Hospital, we called Sharon to let her know what was going on and she came right over to help. She brought food too and that helped a lot.

Melissa is hanging out with me in the lobby. That crappy TV show 'identity' is on now and I'm starting to catch up on what happened at work today. Wish us luck, its been a long day and I've got the feeling that its going to be a long night too.

<i>Update 8:05 pm</i>: One of the doctors cleared the Vanessa issue immediately and now Vanessa is back with Carolyn and Sharon. I feel very relieved.

<i>Update 10:50 pm</i>: CT showed that everything is 'normal' and the doctors don't know why or where whatever it is that is causing Carolyn's abdomen to hurt. They told us that she should use the rest of the meds they gave her and by the time she uses them all if it doesn't go away to come back and they'll try something different.
