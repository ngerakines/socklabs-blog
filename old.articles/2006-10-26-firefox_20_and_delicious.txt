    Firefox 2.0 And Delicious
---

Firefox 2.0 was officially released recently. My first impression is that I really like it. While the overall UI really hasn't changed much I've noticed that it just feels faster. I havn't bothered looking or comparing memory usage quite yet, but I'm very interested to see what the Mozilla team has done to improve performance.

One of the first things I did was install the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> bookmark extension. They've really done a top-notch job with this one. I love being able to use Delicious as the backend storage mechanism for all of my bookmarks. I've even found a few things that surprised me.

One of the things you can do with Delicious now is use a 'shortcut:x' tag. This is essentially how firefox deals with creating dynamic search bookmarks using a keyword. So when I bookmark cpan search I can replace the search term in the url with '%s' and add the tag 'shortcut:cpan' and in Delicious it gives me a nifty text input which I can then use to make searches in cpan. After talking with some of the team Delicious members I also found out that you can view all of the public user contributed search urls by going to <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/system:shortcuts">http://del.icio.us/tag/system:shortcuts</a>. Good job guys, this is hot.
