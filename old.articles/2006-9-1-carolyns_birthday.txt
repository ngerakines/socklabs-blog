    Carolyn's birthday
---

Carolyn's birthday is approaching quickly (Sept 11th). I've been struggling to find something that is more than just dinner and flowers that also fits in with being due very soon after. I've finally decided to just go for it and our tentative plans are to see Elton John on the 15th.

Don't worry, she already knows so its ok to blog about it. I'm really excited to take her and I think she'll enjoy the show. The seats aren't bad and I'm sure it'll be a great time.
