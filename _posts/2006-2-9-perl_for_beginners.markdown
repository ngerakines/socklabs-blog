    Perl For Beginners
---

I 'm lucky enough to work at a company that has more developers than it does
non-developers. There is a huge amount of brain power and a lot of very smart and adaptive people. It seems that at least 90% of the developers use Perl and over 60% of the developers know css/html with some javascript thrown in there.

One of the project managers that sits near by asked if I would help them learn to code. I figure this is a great chance to help someone and also get a beginners guide out there as well.

There are plenty of how-to guides, books and manuals that teach the basics of perl and some on top of that. What I have not see, however, are any guides or essays that teach you how to learn perl by example.

What I've started to do is write a series of perl scripts that teach various levels of perl by example. They have working ( and some broken ) code to show how the flow of logic works.
