    An early father's day
---

For a while I've been wanting an Apple TV. Every time I mentioned it I got shot down by Carolyn and now I know why: She's been trying very hard for a long time to discourage me from getting it so she could get it for me as a father's day gift. I was completely surprised. I was foolishly mistaking her negativity toward it as simple dislike, but really she was plotting all along.

The end result is that we've got one and I like it. Well, for the most part. I've only had it for a few days but these are my thoughts.

(a) We have an old 802.11b/g router and it took several (5+) hours to sync and catalog about 12 gigs of photos, music and tv shows. Unless having an 802.11n router really makes a difference when you first get one be prepared to wait for a while.

(b) 40 gigs really doesn't feel like much, however I've synced everything on my MBP and I've still got plenty of room to grow.

(c) Check out the modding/diy community. There are tons of guides out there on how to upgrade your Apple TV's hard drive [1], use your Apple TV as a feed reader [2], use it as an itunes share and the list goes on and on.

(d) I feel like it wouldn't make any sense to own an Apple TV if Carolyn didn't have her computer and additional content as well. If it were just me I'd be happy with watching TV/Movies on my laptop. But because we can watch TV and movies that we enjoy as well as start to create a kiddy-movie library as well, I makes sense for us.

(e) It gets HOT don't put anything on it or obstruct the flow of air. I might need to build a fan or cooling system for the TV stand as is. Between the TV, Tivo, cable box, dvd player and now the Apple TV that entire area is a fire hazard.

Maybe I'll change my mind about it later but for now I couldn't be happier with it.
