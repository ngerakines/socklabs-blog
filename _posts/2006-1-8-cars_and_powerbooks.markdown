    Cars and powerbooks
---

I had a big scare tonight when my powerbook was acting up. I have a stack of old cds that I've been going through and cleaning out, and one of them really bogged my machine down. For about 3 hours my machine was completely out of commission. It was running at about a 10th of its regular speed and would freeze. It took some time, but I finally found the firmware command to manually eject the cd. Went also to check on Tom today and found that the back left tire was almost completely deflated. I'm glad that I had a spare.

In the mean time, I've been playing with Google Earth, a version that I found for OS X. It looks really cool. I've been a linux/mac user for the longest time and have miss out on all of fluff programs that are only for windows. Enjoy some screenshots.
