The Gerakines family is finally home. Vanessa is in the swing sound asleep, Carolyn and I are on the couch resting and all is quiet. I'm enjoying every moment of this.

I really want to keep business to a minimum so everyone can unwind and just take care of what needs to be done. I'll post pictures soon but for now most of them are on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock/">flickr</a>.
