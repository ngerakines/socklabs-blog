    Once again, another Lost
---

Lately the blog entries have been straying away from my personal life. Nothing special really, but lots of technical things going on. Site updates, research and design at work, technical thoughts and meditations, and of course lots of code.

Soo here is a change. Carolyn and I are hanging around at home. We both had a good day at work and both of us are very happy to not think. So we are going to watch the latest episode of <em>Lost</em>. A while ago I was thinking of doing a show by show analysis but that never got started because I really don't have the time.

Show is about to start. More later.

So this episode of Lost wasn't that great. Since it is getting kinda late, I think we are going to conk out for the night.

Tomorrow is the holiday party for SixApart. We have a ton of people from foreign offices town for the event and I'm meeting lots of new faces. It will be a lot of fun.
