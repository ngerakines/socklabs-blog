So, here we are. Houston. Blah, I hate Texas.

There was a bit of traffic on I-10 before Lake Charles, but it was a quiet ride. We are staying the Best Western near the IKEA. It has internet access and a place to do laundry, so I'm happy. We figure that it'd be best and easiest to take I-10 all the way up, but it'll take us through San Antonio, El Paso and Los Angeles on the way over. I think we'll also be driving through the Grand Canyon too, that has me real excited. I've never been there before.

Before we left New Orleans we picked up an AC/DC converter and Carolyn's been playing The Sims on my laptop while I drive. Its kinda nice because we can listen to podcasts, play games, whatever while on the road.

Anywho, I'm off to do laundry and get ready. More pictures to come later.
