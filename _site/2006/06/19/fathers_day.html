		 	<p>This past weekend was my first Fathers Day and Carolyn decided to make things real special for me. We slept in a bit, had a really good breakfast, went to get Tom out of storage and later in the evening had dinner with Michael, Karen and Karen's parents.</p>

<p>No day goes on without a twist and today was no exception. We left for storage right around noon and were planning on spending maybe 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on traffic. The first error was that I didn't have the gate code. Fortunately there was someone heading out just as we were heading in. That was relatively minor compared to the big issue: Tom wouldn't start.</p>

<p>I don't claim to be an expert with cars, especially classics, but I do know my way around the engine and I've spent a lot of time getting to know how they work and what everything does. We ended up spending 4 hours moving everything that was blocking it, getting it out, starting it, putting everything else back inside and then trying to start the car again.</p>

<p>Carolyn really didn't let her frustration show until 3:30 or so after we had Tom out, everything else back in and it wouldn't start up again. Needless to say, it was a long and tiring day.</p>

<p>Once it was going though, it was just like the old days. I use the phrase old days very loosely here. One of the tires was running low so we just made one quick stop to add some air and we were on our way. The traffic was pretty crap in Oakland but once we got outside of the area it was smooth ride home.</p>

<p>I'm soo very happy to have him back again. He needs some cosmetic work, but all in all he's in great shape. The next time I start him up, it'll be to take him to get an oil change and the solenoid, replaced. I'm also going to be looking around for quotes on a fresh coat of paint and some cosmetic work.</p>
