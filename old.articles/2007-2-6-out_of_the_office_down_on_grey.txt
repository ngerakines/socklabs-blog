    Out of The Office, down on Grey
---

Carolyn and I finished the first two seasons of The Office and caught up with the 3rd just last week. Now we can add it to the growing list of TV shows that we really like to watch but end up watching on iTunes or via DVD.

A few nights ago Carolyn downloaded a couple episodes of Grey's Anatomy and we started on that series. So far it is pretty good, although I havn't decided if I really like it or not. My first gripe is the intro. What does it have to do with anything? It feels completely out of place. I'm also not a huge fan of Ellen Pompeo's character. I can't tell if she's just really cutesy or if she's a bad actress. I do, however, think that they have an outstanding cast otherwise.

We've also been talking about the pros and cons of an Apple TV. Right now it doesn't make much sense to shell out to get one, but I'm hoping that the next generation will have bigger drives and can hold more.
