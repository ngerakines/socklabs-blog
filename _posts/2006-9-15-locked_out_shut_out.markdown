    Locked out .. shut out?

I'm sitting in the Starbucks across from my office building, waiting for someone to let me in. I've done a great job of consistently leaving my key at home when I need it most. At least the coffee isn't bad.

Today is going to be exciting. I'm leaving work a little early to get a head start on a trip up to Sacramento with Carolyn. For her birthday I got her tickets to see Elton John. I think the show starts at 7 or 8 pm but we are going to stay the night and need to check into the hotel. Its going to be a great weekend.
