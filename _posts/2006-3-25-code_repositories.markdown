    Code Repositories

One thing that CPAN doesn't offer, and I seriously wish they did, is repository access. If once you created a module and uploaded it to CPAN it would be sooo wonderful if you could also host your code and development on CPAN as well via a subversion or cvs repository.

Until then we have other options. I've never been a fan of using a local subversion repository because if my laptop breaks or gets stolen, then it is most likely lost forever. I really don't like SourceForge either, but Tigris isn't bad at all.

Not too long ago SixApart started <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/">code.sixapart.com</a> small niche of open source projects started by people who work at sixapart. Its a real nice concept actually. It is nothing terribly fancy or complex, but a simple subversion repository and a place to talk about your project.

I've put up a few of my projects up already: <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/svn/Audio-AMR-Decode">Audio::AMR::Decode</a>, <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/svn/WWW-NameGen/">WWW::NameGen</a>, <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/svn/WWW-Yahoo-KeywordExtractor/">WWW::Yahoo::KeywordExtractor</a> and <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/svn/SenseNet/">SenseNet</a>.

The first three are already on cpan, see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~/sock">http://search.cpan.org/~/sock</a>, but the last is still in development. Its getting big enough to need its own project blog, so sooner or later I'll put one up for it.
