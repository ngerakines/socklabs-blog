    Upcoming and recent Erlang presentations
---

I've been thrilled to work with Mark Zweifel on a series of presentations about using Erlang while on the Delicious backend team. A few months back I submitted the presentation when the call for papers announcement was made for CUFP. [CUFP](http://cufp.galois.com/) (Commercial Users of Functional Programming) is an annual sub-conference for the larger [ICFP](http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/) (International Conference on Functional Programming) conference held every year at varying locations.

The "Developing Erlang at Yahoo" presentation proposal was accepted and I'll be giving that presentation on the 27th of September at 4:10pm. I'm pretty sure that a recording of the presentation will be available soon after.

Mark and I gave a small preview of this presentation at the September BayFP meeting. The slides and video have been posted on the [http://www.bayfp.org/blog](http://www.bayfp.org/blog) website.

The presentation that I'll be giving at CUFP will be a condensed version of the BayFP one given time constraints. I'll make those slides available online this weekend.
