    The Da Vinci Code

Let me start off by saying that I would of rather bought a junkie another hit than see this again. I know that may seem a bit harsh at first, but it goes to show the level of disgust that I feel for this film.

Although I did read the book quite a while ago, its plot and details are still relatively fresh in my mind. The book and film left a very large amount of nausea to fill the gap left by the time wasted on it.

Being some one who has a fair understanding of history, told and untold, as well as someone who is a Freemason and member of the Scottish Rite, I found this movie was uneasy.
