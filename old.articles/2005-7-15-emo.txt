Was browsing the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/">urban dictionary</a> and found this hillarious entry for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emo">emo</a>. See the example.

<blockquote>
girlfriend: C'mon, lets have sex.
boyfriend: I'm too sad to have sex.
girlfriend: I'm sad too; lets have sex and cry.
boyfriend: I'm already crying.
</blockquote>
