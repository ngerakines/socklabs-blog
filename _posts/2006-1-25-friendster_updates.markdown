    Friendster updates
---

I logged into <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">friendster</a> for the first time in a while and update <a href="http://www.friendster.com/profiles/ngerakines">my profile</a>. I really havn't heard much about friendster in the blogosphere lately, but it looks like they are going pretty strong. I often wonder how they feel about competitors like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">myspace</a> or <a href="http://www.tagged.com">tagged</a>.

Although, when telling a friend about friendster the other day, I referred to them as myspace for adults. I think it holds true.
