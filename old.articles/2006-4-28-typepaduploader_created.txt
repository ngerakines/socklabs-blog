    TypePad-Uploader Created
---

Today at work I created an open source cocoa application that lets you upload images directly from your desktop to TypePad. It is rightly named 'TypePad-Uploader' and now has its own <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/typepad-uploader/">project blog</a>. It also has more information on how to download and use it.

Its purpose is simple: To let you easily upload images to TypePad by dragging them onto the application. It needs some work and a little bit of polishing but its a good start and I've got a lot planned for it.

Any questions, comments and the like should be left on the <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/typepad-uploader/">project blog</a> in the appropriate area.
