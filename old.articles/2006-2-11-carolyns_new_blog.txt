    Carolyn's new blog
---

So tonight at muddys I convinced Carolyn to switch over to MovabeType. It wasn't really difficult to get her to migrate, but it made me happy. About 20 minutes later I had the majority of her posts migrated over and a nice and pretty theme set up. She hasn't posted much lately, but I think she'll start posting more often now.
