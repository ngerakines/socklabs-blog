<p>I've gotten a real kick out of the community uproar over spam blogs, thus dubbed splogs, that have been all of a sudden appearing on the internet. Come on people, these things have been around for months now. Everyone wants to point and rant about how they devastating they are and how much damage they do and blah blah blah. Really now, have you only noticed them these past few days?</p>

<p>One of the first roles that I assumed at Feedster was how to deal with spam on the crawling side of things. Since then I've been slowly implementing layer upon layer of spam and content filtering and I've been quite pleased with the results. From what I can see, the spam that plagues our database is starting to clear up and you can tell through the results of our search engine.</p>

<p><i>Had to remove some of the details of this post.</i></p>

<p>And for everyone who didn't realize this was coming, I feel sorry for you. Anyone with half a brain and any foresight could see this was going to hit us all sooner or later. Its just another form of marketing, yeah it sucks but its not going to go away as long as the spammers are making money. Follow the money, it won't lead you wrong.</p>
