    The spin on this week
---

I'll start off by saying that job hunting is going well. I've got 3 places in mind and now the only thing left to do is work out the logistics. The plan was to move down to New Orleans and become a contractor. After the visit this past christmas and then family matters, I think it best that I stay in San Francisco. I kinda wish I knew what I know now before making some fairly big decisions, but thats life.

I'm hoping that the <a xhref="http://blog.socklabs.com/2006/01/02/wallet-stolen/">mess with my wallet</a> will become resolved soon. I'm 99.99 % sure that I know who it was and how they did it, but now its a matter of working it out with the police and actually nabbing the guy. I also need to let WellsFargo know what is going on too. I should do some more research on credit card fraud and what the liabilities are. I've got an appointment on Monday to go to the DMV to get a new driver's license, not really looking forward to it.

Today Carolyn and I are in San Jose at the court house. There are some custody issues surrounding Melissa, her younger sister. I don't think I can make any comment on it. Last night though we did pick up <em>The Sims 2: University</em> from the apple store. She's been glued to my powerbook playing and it looks like a lot of fun. I have to admit that once she went to bed I stayed up pretty late playing.

Yesterday the big event was spending time at the genius bar in the apple store trying to get Carolyn's iBook fixed. We were there for a little over 4 hours testing the hard drive and other components. The guy that was helping us was really friendly and helpful although in the end it didn't get resolved. I think this is an excuse for her to get a new powerbook.

In the tech world a lot has been going on. <a xhref="http://www.macworldexpo.com/">MacWorld</a> is coming up and I'm getting really excited about it. There was also quite a bit of buzz about <a xhref="http://news.google.com/news?q=microsoft+buy+yahoo&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr">Microsoft showing some interest in purchasing Yahoo</a>. There was also a flood of talk about something called a <a xhref="http://gadgets.fosfor.se/the-google-cube/"><em>GoogleCube</em></a> but thankfully it turned out to be a hoax ( I think ). <a xhref="http://fuzzyblog.com">Scott</a> has also been pretty chatty about a project called <a xhref="http://ookles.com/">Ookles</a>.

The past few months I've been developing a plan on how I can convert Ben and Charlie, my youngest brothers, to mac users. For christmas I got them both games that are for the PC but also have mac versions. Also been helping them with iTunes and some other applications that are both PC and mac friendly. The idea is that soon enough if I get them a mac-mini it will be a pretty easy switch.

The official 1.9 patch for the game <em>World of Warcraft</em> was released a few days ago. It boasted some pretty cool enhancements and changes. If only I played more. My poor character Swiftburn is getting neglected pretty badly. Carolyn made a character not too long ago and said she enjoyed the game. If ever things settle down it wouldn't be so bad to group and hack at some things.

I'm hooked to <em>Lost</em> and counting down the days. Next episode airs next Wednesday, Jan 11th and is called "Lost: Revelation". I'm hoping to see some resolution but no doubt that this far into the season they will only give more puzzling scenes and cliffhangers. I was listening to the <a xhref="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcasts.html">official podcast</a> but this one: <a xhref="http://www.hawaiiup.com/lost/">LOST Podcast: The Transmission</a> is much much better in my opinion.

I think that is everything for now. I'm going to continue upgrading <a xhref="http://bm.e1a3.com/">Bookmarks</a> to use Apache2+mod_perl2 while the cafe is still open. Then back to playing Starcraft. More later as things change.
