    Fireworks Galore!

Happy Birthday America!

This was my first 4th of July in Los Angeles. The evening was looking pretty boring until Sterling came along and told me that we should head over to the park. Its only a few blocks away so it didn't take long to get there, but when we did my jaw dropped. There must of been over a thousand people all shooting fireworks off at the same time. I was amazed.

This weekend wasn't that bad. We all left a bit early on Friday and took Monday off because of the holiday. I did a bit of work on bookmarks.com and worked on some personal projects. Also played some world of warcraft and got Swiftburn up to 33. The big news is that tomorrow afternoon I'm headed to Orange to pick up my mustang again. So far, between the fireworks, getting my mustang back and the trip to New Orleans, this is one of the best weeks this year.
