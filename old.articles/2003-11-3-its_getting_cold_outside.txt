Around 5am i woke up to head to work. I had volunteered to work at the Hesperia High School shelter for all of the fire evacuees. My shift was supposed to be from 6a to 12p. A good 6 hours that I got paid time and a half. I got dressed and ready faster than i thought I would and got there around 530 and quickly brewed a pot of coffee for the morning workers. Another guy named nick, from the apple valley store, showed up around 10 til and so did stephanie. There was a bit of confusion about who was supposed to be there because only 2 people were scheduled to work. He went over to the Sultana High school and we havn't heard from him since. The morning was really slow. To be honest I could hardly believe that we were getting paid to be there. We, maybe, brewed 3 pots of coffee. Around 12 no one showed up. Jessica and Deserie, my relieves, never came and stephanie had to leave so I stayed until 5p. That was a full day. I worked from 530a to 5p, 11 and a half hours. Woot! That helped this week's check alot.

I left right at 5pm. I was exhausted and was really sick of being there, to be honest. I mean don't get me wrong but 12 hours of sitting around bored and brewing coffee will get to you.
