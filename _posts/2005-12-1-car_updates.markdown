I heard from my mechanic today and he gave me a quote on what it will take to redo the electrical and driver's side window in the mustang. He said the total looks to be around 230$, which I think is bloody awesome. Soon Tom is going to be in tip-top shape. All he needs now is a good coat of pain and some new carpet and he'll be good as new.
