    The launch of BlogSource
---

At work we recently launched <a href="http://www.blogsource.com/">BlogSource.Com</a>, an easy to use personal blogging system.

The premise is fairly simple. We wanted to create a very simplistic blogging platform that could easily be used by the internet novice or expert perl developer. Kim, Alissa and I set out to do just that. The past few months have involved alot of planning meetings and late nights but we all feel very good about what we've got.

Our roadmap is looking very good right now. We've got a ton of very cool, and inovate, features that you probly won't find anywhere else. Alot of these features are in the skunkworks right now and we hope to have the next release go just as smoothly as the current.
