    Dinner with Carolyn
---

Last night was my date with Carolyn. I went strait to the CalTrans station and boarded on a bullet train to San Jose where we met up. It wasn't your average date by any means. It all started out at `Bed, Bath and Beyond` to get towels and then managed to migrate toward dinner and movies at my place. 

I have to say that I am very impressed with this one. She has her head on strait and seems to have a good grasp on reality and how the world works. She's sophisticated and has class, something which seems to be vanishing in this day's society, and I'm really liking what is going on.

This morning we went out and got breakfast and then went to this Museum called 'The Legion of Honor' in Golden Gate park. We had a great time both last night in San Jose and this morning in the city proper. I think we are going to hang out more and more, and I'm totally happy with this developing into something more.
