    How to use this blog
---

On the world wide web there are a growing number of <em>project blogs</em>. I think these are great because they really allow for a lot of flexibility. Instead of creating a static page to point to downloads, you simply tag or categorize posts so you can easy direct to the most recent download post. Developer documentation is also simplified because of the search and organization that most blogging systems offer.

This is my attempt at creating a developer blog for the <em>CloudNine</em> plugin. Here you will find information regarding releases, documentation, bugs and features.

It is using a loose tag organization. If you want to find the most recent release you can always find it at the top entry tagged 'release'. If you are looking for documentation check items tagged 'documentation'. The rest is pretty self explanatory.

The site is open to comment and trackback so please provide as much feedback as possible.
