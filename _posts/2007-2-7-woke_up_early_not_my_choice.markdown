    Woke up early, not my choice
---

Wow, I'm usually not up this early. Around 5:00 am I just woke up and felt completely awake. Its kind of a crummy feeling when you really really want to be asleep. Kind of reminds me of working at starbucks. You'd work 2 weeks of opening shifts and for 3 days after you find yourself waking up at 4:00 am just because.

Yesterday I went home from work early because I'm feeling sick. I conked out for a few hours and then she woke me up so I'd be able to sleep through the night. Kind of glad she did right now.

The house feels quiet. I'm kind of glad that I'm awake, I appreciate the calm more now.
