    Wallet Stolen
---

Last night at the party someone stole my wallet. I've already filed reports and have full lists of where they used my visa and the times, so I'm going to go to those places and start scratching the chalk board.

If stuff like this keeps up I'm going to change the site theme to something resembling Good Charlotte rock scene gone emo.
