    Continued development of release 0.8
---

Development of release 0.8 is chugging along. I've got a bucket of ideas to pull from thanks to the email that I've been getting from users and testers.

One of the main things that I'm working on right now is adjusting the prefs in a way that puts more of a focus on content. Instead of telling the application how to handle blogs and galleries, we use the preferences to describe how we want to handle images or videos or text.

I'm also working on adding TypeList support which will really open up some new doors. Right now I think I'm only going to build in support for url lists but that might soon change.

If anyone knows a good cocoa/c library for getting amazon item information out of amazon urls let me know.
