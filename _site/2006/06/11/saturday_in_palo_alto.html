		 	<p>Today has felt extremely productive even though I slept pretty late. Its not very often that I get the chance. To top it off, Carolyn made waffles for lunch/breakfast.</p>

<p>So Carolyn and I mucked around and played Neopets for a while before we left the house. Its kinda nice being able to do nothing if you want to. We talked about going for a walk and maybe getting a new book or two so we made our way over to Palo Alto.</p>

<p>I was pretty excited about getting Mercedes Lackey's new book 'When Darkness Falls' but I must of been confused about the release date as it comes out in July, not June. We did pick up another Madeline book for Peanut as well as Maddox's new book The Alphabet of Manliness.</p>

<p>Since it was a nice day out, we decided to do some walking instead of heading back home. Palo Alto is pretty nice and I've got no objection to spending time there. After going into a few stores we got sushi for a late lunch / early dinner. It was good.</p>

<p>Back at home I got an IM from my brother Charlie back in Florida. He, Carolyn and I played some Neopets, but for the most part I spent my time programming. We got back home around 5pm-ish and continued hacking on Fence and didn't actually stop until 20 minutes or so.</p>

<p>I did get a lot done though and I'm very happy to say that Fence has a much cleaner object interface. The codebase, documentation not included, is hitting about 3,000 lines of compact code. Not too shabby.</p>

<p>Now we are in bed, me on my laptop and Carolyn watching Beauty and The Beast. I've got a few things that I'd like to smooth out before I crash for the night, but I'm really satisfied with myself already.</p>
