		 	<p>Today I had a great time with my friends and family. I say family because several of the people there have become real and true family to me. They have been there for me during times when no one else has been, either with advice or just to listen. I am truly thankful.</p>

<p>There was very little business talk and we all kept work away from the party. There were a few moments here and there were someone needed to rant about something or just say how cool xyz was that they worked on.</p>

<p>I won't name drop, but there was quite a crowd. Even better was that everyone brought the family with them. It was a lot of fun playing with the kids and running around. We even had a chocolate fountain which has somehow become the centerpiece for all of the <em>cool</em> parties.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a good time. I got to really connect with a close friend once again and it meant alot to me. Thanks.</p>
