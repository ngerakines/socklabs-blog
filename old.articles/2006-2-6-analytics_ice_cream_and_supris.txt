    Analytics, Ice Cream and Suprises
---

Google Analytics mysteriously started working today. It made me quite happy. For the longest time I've been using Webalizer and AwStats for site analysis. Nothing special, nothing to fluffy. All I'm really concerned about is bandwidth used, total # of hits and of course search terms. With Google Analytics though, things have changed. Now I can get really pretty graphs and charts to break down every aspect of my site's traffic and ratings. Its really quite impressive.

Work was really good too. I squashed my first real bug today, updating the atom templates from version 0.3 to 1.0. I'll bring all of the atom feeds up to spec for TypePad. Aside from that I got a few other things finished and did some reporting/statistics work.

Carolyn came over for lunch because I accident took her power cord to work with me. We had Quiznos and it wasn't that bad.

After work we decided to get back out of the house and went down to the warf for dinner. We walked around then made it over to Ghirardelli square.
