    Getting ready for change

<blockquote>Motion, of necessity, involves a change in perspective.</blockquote>

In San Jose the past two days, taking care of a few things. Got home not too long ago and finally have the chance to straiten some things out. Needless to say, life has been quite hecktic.

I don't really know where to begin, so I'll start with Monday. Chelsea showed up at my door early Monday morning. There was no warning or notice, just showed up. She had left southern California around 2 or 3 am the night before and hadn't slept any in several days. I normally don't go into personal matters like this, but it was really disturbing. One doesn't have to think very hard at the surprise, but even more the reaction Carolyn had. I've got to hand it to her, she handled everything very calmly and well.

I'm frustrated with her. Chelsea is really causing a lot of headache for me, Carolyn, Soozie and even herself.

Today Carolyn and I were stuck in San Jose. Not bad, but didn't have much of an option as to what to do in the immediate area so we went to <a href="http://www.thetech.org/">The Tech Museum of Innovation</a>. We took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock">some pictures</a> and had a good time. We also caught an IMAX showing of <a href="http://www.thetech.org/imax/filmdetail/?movie=FON&amp;ref=current">Forces of Nature</a> on the dome screen. It was really neat.

On a different note, out of Apple comes dual core intel computers. They announced and gave demonstrations of the new iMac computers and presented some really awesome specs and benchmarks. They also announced how they plan on migrating all of the Apple computers over to the intel chipsets. I'm still kinda weary about that sort of migration, but I'm pretty confident that in the end it won't be a bad thing.

Another very cool thing was the set of updates and changes to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a> to make photocasting and podcasting easier than ever. I wonder how this will affect products like <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/">Podcast Maker</a> and the like. I suppose that this isn't the end as to the announcements and changes that are in store for consumers.

In other news, Tom is having issues with the power steering pump. Carolyn officially got a job at starbucks and starts soon.

Ohh, I should also mention that good friend <a href="http://www.fuzzyblog.com/">Scott Johnson</a> will be in San Francisco and hosting ( not paying for ) a dinner at <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/details?id=21349747">Chaat</a> on the 19th. It'll be a nice and informal meet-and-greet. See <a href="http://fuzzyblog.com/archives/2006/01/10/meet-the-scott-dinner/">his post</a> for more information.
