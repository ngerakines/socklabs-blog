The past couple of days have been really busy. To start off let me say that I just realized that I made a joke about getting laid in a previous post and it really was a joke. I just dawned upon me that I probably look like a jackass. Moving right along. Brent has been out here for the past few weeks and stayed over this past weekend. We've had a lot of fun and its nice to see each other. I set him up with a website, yeah he has an online journal/blog, who would of thought. The address is <a href="http://www.burningwind.com">http://www.burningwind.com</a> and he's made a good bit of posts so far. Anyway, life isn't bad. Making a few new friends here and there, having a lot of fun in life. I have a pretty bright outlook on things but I'm staying cautious. And about to leave the office, post again some time later.
