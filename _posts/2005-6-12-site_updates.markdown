In the next few weeks I'll be migrating my website to an updated system that I created called <a href="http://lithe.socklabs.com/">Lithe</a>. Its an xml/xslt based content management system that I'm hoping will be an improvement from drupal. I've built it in a way that the data storage methods are similar to drupal so there won't be any huge conversion taking place. The links and such should remain the same as well.

I'd also like to mention that the addition of this server to the Tor network seems to be going very well. Its been active for the past few days, and eating quite a bit of bandwidth, but all in all I think it was a good idea. Checkout the <a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor project website</a> for more information.
