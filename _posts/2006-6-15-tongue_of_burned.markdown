    Tongue of burned
---

Once again, blogging from the train and on my way to work. I'm heading in a bit earlier than usual to get some bugs fixed before a meeting at 10:00 am. Never a dull moment. This sort of thing makes me wonder how much I'm going to appreciate the quiet of the train once Peanut is born. The morning train has an odd assortment of people, mostly seniors knitting. I would of never guessed.

Yesterday was visit #3 in saga of my root canal. Went to Sephi's office and they fit me with a temporary crown and sent off the mold for a permanent one. I forgot to ask at the time, but I wonder how long the permanent ones last? For the most part I'm fine, but my tongue feels soooo badly burned and sore for some reason. I can barely eat with it. There isn't much I can do at the moment, but if it doesn't clear itself up over the next few days I'll probably have to go back and get something for it. Uggg

I'm really looking forward to this weekend. Carolyn and I are planning on getting Tom out of storage on Sunday and that makes me very happy. Saturday morning I'll also be sitting in on a Bethel at lodge too.
