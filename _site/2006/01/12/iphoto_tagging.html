		 	<p>I've been searching around for an easy way to manage the many pictures I have in iPhoto. Recently at the Macworld Expo Apple announced that iPhoto has support for 250,000 images unlike its previous limit of 25,000. That, in combination of having a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sock/">pro flickr account</a>, makes me want to start taking more pictures and be able to organize them as I go along. There are a few different ways to go about this.</p>

<p>The first thing that I've discovered is that having good meta data helps an awful lot. When I say meta-data I mean everything about an image. Having a good title and a meaningful description is essential. But also setting a rating as well as making sure the date and time is accurate is valuable too. In most cases we take pictures in bursts or groups. When I go out on a road trip I don't take one picture at a time, upload it and then continue with my next picture. I take one or two hundred and add them to my library all at once. This makes it very easy to use date/time based organization. Creating 'smart' albums based on date and/or time ranges is an easy start.</p>

<p>The next thing that I've figured out is that iPhoto makes it very hard to use keywords effectively. I havn't found any easy way to assign keywords, aka tags, in batch. This makes tagging difficult for people who don't want to spend several hours organizing a set of 50 or 100 imported pictures. Although somewhat of a time eater, keywords is pretty handy. Having names as keywords makes it very easy to have a smart album of friends or family.</p>

<p>Through all of this I've found a few applications that help. The first one is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kenferry/software.html">Keyword Assistant for iPhoto</a>. This one makes it very easy to add tags on the fly. It even does name lookups against your address book. The next tool that I've found to be essential is <a href="http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/">FlickrExport</a>. This handy tool will help you export pictures from iPhoto to Flickr. It'll even cary across the keywords you've designated in iPhoto as tags in flickr.</p>
