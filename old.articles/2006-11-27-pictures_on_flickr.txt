    Pictures on Flickr
---

I'm glad to be home. I've posted a batch of pictures to flickr from the Las Vegas trip. There was also a few from the past few weeks of Vanessa and Carolyn too. Last night was kind of rough, Vanessa was really fussy last night and apparently all day. When I got home she was pretty fussy as well and it looks like tonight won't be easy.

This week is going to be busy but I'm looking forward to everything. Tomorrow Carolyn is taking Vanessa to her next doctor appointment for her next round of shots. I guess there isn't anything else 'planned' outside of work stuff. This weekend is going to be a lot of fun.

I should go offline and continue cleaning.
