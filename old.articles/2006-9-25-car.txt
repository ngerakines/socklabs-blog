    Car!

Oh man, what a way to start the week. This morning on the way to work the train I was on hit a car right before Palo Alto station [<a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/25/BAGNALCASN6.DTL">1</a>] [<a href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/9929276/detail.html">2</a>] [<a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/15605077.htm">3</a>] [<a href="http://www.sfist.com/archives/2006/09/25/your_commute_caltrain_delays.php">4</a>]. In the time it took to switch cars and finally get going, I would of made it to work twice.

This weekend wasn't so bad, so I wonder where the bad karma came from. What surprised me the most are the stories that some of the people made up while talking to people on the phone. I was in the last car and we felt a pretty big jolt and the lights went out and then we waited almost 2 hours to get transfered onto another train. Some of the people were making calls saying that the train was smashed and destroyed and that they had to get moved off the train and then bussed to another station to then wait even longer. Isn't the story exciting enough on its own?
