    Tom is free

The majority of today was spent dealing with car stuff. Days like this frustrate me in a very special way because of the hoops that you have to jump through to get even the simplest of things done.

I literally spent all of my time from 9:00 am to 3:45 pm dealing with getting Tom out of the yard. It included an absurd amount of walking to and from 7th street and frustration with the people behind the counter who couldn't care one way or another about you or your problems.

Oh, and once it was all said and done the car wouldn't start and it took over an hour to finally get it going.

I will counter all of this and say that it felt sooo damn good riding in the mustang again. I can easily admit that some of the best parts of my life involved that car.

<a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/carolyn/">Carolyn</a> has a really busy work schedule over the next few weeks but I think we are going to go on a roadtrip soon-ish. Idealy we will be heading down to LA to pickup the grand-am and stuff from storage.

But even a day trip in or around the bay wouldn't be so bad. I think we've got plans to look at some <a href="http://www.housingmaps.com/?c=sf_pen&t=apa&p=1500_2000">housing in Mountain View</a> on Sunday and then have dinner at her Dad's house. I think both of us are really cautious about it though, her sister has been a real monster and neither of us want to deal with her.

I decided to take <a href="http://www.authenticgeek.net/">Nick</a>'s advice and put <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/cloudnine/">CloudNine</a> on the shelf for a while. He says that it wouldn't be a bad thing know that currently it is stable, pretty feature complete and dare I say 3.3 friendly.

I'm really liking the way my blog is working out with tags and such. I've almost gone through all of the posts in the past 6 months and tagged them accordingly. I really like being able to display the <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/tags">tag cloud</a> and use it myself for find posts. I've also really loved being able to intigreate OpenID throughout the site. <a href="http://markpasc.org/">Mark Paschal</a> wrote the really awesome plugins to allow you to comment and log in via OpenID.

Development on mod_captcha has slowed a bit and I've been spending more time planning and writing documentation for it. I should probably start posting code and stuff up for it. Maybe even make a project blog for it? We'll see how it goes. I've also got a few other apache module ideas that I'd really love to hack at, but one at a time is probably the best course of action at the moment.

I havn't been blogging much the past week or so but a lot has been going on. I'd really love to sit down and write semi-reviews of the movies that I've seen and even a web service that I've been trying out.

This weekend is going to be fun. I just want to relax and not deal with car stuff. Saturday is cleaning and laundry day. I'd also like to churn some code and possible get the project blog started. Sunday my flatmate is inviting some people over and making crepes. Aparently she's got a nack for making really good crepes and she does this sort of thing once a year. Looking forward to good food.

I think thats all for now.
