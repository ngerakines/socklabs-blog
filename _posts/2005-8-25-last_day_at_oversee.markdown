    Last day at Oversee
---

As I'm sure everyone is aware by now, I've left Oversee for better ventures. Today is my last day and its full of cleanup, pass offs and random chit chats. The entire experience is going very well, I didn't really expect anything out of the ordinary, and I couldn't ask for more really. All I have to do now is update contact information with a select few and be on my way!
