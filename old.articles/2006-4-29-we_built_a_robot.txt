    We built a robot!

Hachi came over today and the three of us hung out all day. While I'll probably blog about that later, I want to mention before I crash into bed that we mad a motorized boat today.

<a href="http://authenticgeek.net">Nick</a> really inspired me to get back into electronics and during a trip to Fry's with Carolyn and Jonathan we picked up an solar powered boat kit and put it together. I've got a few pictures up on my <a href="http://ngerakines.typepad.com/">photoblog</a>, although I do plan on taking better ones.

While at Frys I also picked up the book 'RFID Toys' which really gave me some awesome ideas. If only I can convince <a href="http://exothermia.net/ccc">Eric</a> to send some help this way I might be able to get some things working.
