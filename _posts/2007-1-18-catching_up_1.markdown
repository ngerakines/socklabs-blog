    Catching up
---

This week start strong. I enjoyed having my Monday off and did lots (and I really mean lots) of cleaning. It really made me feel good and productive. Monday night was pretty big too as the new expansion to The World of Warcraft was released at midnight. Carolyn and I both debated going to the Fry's and picking it up but the combination of waiting in line and the cold air sounded really unappealing.

At lunch on Tuesday Les, Toby and I walked over to the Microcenter close to the office and picked up a copy. I oogled over it a bit but got back to work. We've really been in crunch mode lately.

Everyone was pleased to see that Vanessa is in good health and it was nice to hang out with the guys.

Somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday I hit level 40 with Korale on Medivh. Carolyn caught up pretty quickly. We've been both trying to make as much gold as possible and I ended up giving close to 60g so she could buy a mount. She said she was going to save up and help but somehow I don't see that happening.

I'm really looking forward to see some of the clips she's taken of Vanessa. She's told me that some are really funny and others very cute. I've been taking a lot of pictures too. I've posted 40 or so onto flickr over the past week.
