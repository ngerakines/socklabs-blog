		 	<p>As I've said before, we tend to go through movies and tv series by starting from episode one and going on until the show is over. That wasn't such the case for Stargate SG-1. I'm pretty sad when I say that I couldn't stomach anything past season 7. I gave it a really good go, but in the end I was just too disappointed to continue.</p>

<p>The majority of my grief was due to the writer's real lack of effort in the details. Seasons one through six displayed a real focus on the details. Nearly every episode and plot line went through the why, when who and how of what was going on. They tried to fill in the gaps with information that really helped the show move forward. In seasons seven it just blindly jumped from one thing to the next that left me wondering how and why they would do so.</p>

<p>They also started cycling through characters that left the show with an emptiness that they tried to fill, but failed. The cast they ended with in season nine just didn't do the show justice.</p>

<p>In the queue now I've got "Connections" and "The Lost Room", both of which were highly recommended. A few nights ago I saw 300 for the first time. On the other end of the spectrum, Carolyn has been going through Sex and The City which isn't bad.</p>
