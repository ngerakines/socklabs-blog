I've been hacking and playing with MT and learning a lot from it. I've started
to get a good feel of the plugin API and made my first MT plugin called
<em>CategoryCloud</em>.

CategoryCloud allows you to create tag clouds based on category weights ( # of
entries per category ) for your templates. Version 1.0 was released yesterday
and the only functionality that I'd like to add is being able to adjust the
base font size and the colors used. Other than that, I don't have anything
else planned for it.

I've also added BlogRoll and OnThisDay. The BlogRoll plugin lets me adjust the
list of links on the side more easily. The OnThisDay plugin lets me display
what other posts where made on that day over the past years.

I'll be thinking of other plugin ideas that I'd like to see in MT. I've got a
few, but I need to hammer out some of the details before I commit them.
