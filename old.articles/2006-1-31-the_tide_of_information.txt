    The Tide of Information

With ripple of wave and hiss of spray.

I just read an <a href="http://newmediaspin.com/?p=6">inspiring article</a> by <a href="http://newmediaspin.com/">Chris Redlitz</a> regarding the transformation of the information that know of as email. Since its creation email has been the flagship of online communications. It is easy to use, versatile, you can use it from almost anywhere, there are many additions and services to the base concept and it is simple in nature. It is just a block of text with notes on who it is from, who it is to, what the subject is about and the content of the message.

Now, and for comparison, we have a feed. Feeds have been growing more and more popular ever since conception. Within a few short years there are an estimated 30,000,000 feeds available right now, and that number grows ever day. From my point of view nearly 75% of the websites I visit have feeds available with news services, social networks and blogs leading the way.

Feeds are easy to use, versatile, you can use it from almost anywhere, there are many additional services to the base concept and it is simple in nature. Sounds familiar eh?

The internet as we know it is changing. Instead of pestering my mother to let me know what is going on in her life, I just subscribe to her feed. Instead of asking my brother Ben to email me pictures of his latest dirt biking drip, he posts them to flickr and I subscribe to the feed. When there is an announcement at SixApart and all of the employees need to know, there is an internal feed giving us up to the minute information. Many of us use feeds every day and don't even realize it. The same way we used email without really knowing it.

What drives ideas on the internet isn't stability, it is speed. Email is fast, near instant even, but it requires server to server communication, complex network routing, handshakes, verification, lists and so forth. Feeds change all of that. Feeds make one point of contact for a everyone who wants the information. It is the ultimate opt-in.

What we know of as email is changing into what will know of as feeds. Fast, time sensitive, secure and simple.
