    Hit 60, rolling in the outlands
---

Not too long ago Carolyn (<a href="http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Medivh&n=Jeanelly">Jeanelly</a>) and I (<a href="http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Medivh&n=Korale">Korale</a>) both hit 60 and have been loving the outlands. Hellfire peninsula is such an awesome place. We've both been grinding away in the battle grounds so Carolyn can have her epic pvp mount and finally went back into questing mode. Its been a lot of fun so far. It was pretty funny when she got her black battle strider and realized that it has a rear view mirror.

Blizzard did a good job with plot development. The overall theme and story line is very detailed and pulls you in. We also got to the point were we had to choose between the aldor and scryers which was fun because I somehow convinced Carolyn to with the aldor with me. We didn't want a jimmy incident.
