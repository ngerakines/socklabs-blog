    A funeral is not the place to tweet.
---

Every now and then something happens that makes me really think twice about the affects of social networking and the social software that we use so heavily. A guy I know recently attend a funeral and ,although I sincerely give my deepest condolence for his loss, I strongly feel the urge to question his motives for making multiple twitter posts during the event. I understand the thought of twitter, and other (micro)blogging services, being used as an expression of the human experience but isn't there a point where it starts to disconnect you as well?

To tweet something you have to go through a process that requires a lot of attention and focus. You have to take your device, maneuver to the place to post, type up the post (usually the longest part) and submit it. Doing all of that, even if it only takes a minute or two, takes time away from the actual event and situation that you are experiencing.

It is the same reason that many people don't take cameras or video recorders during labor. The time and energy spent on preparing the device, getting everything ready for a shot and taking those shots takes time away from actually experiencing it. It blows my mind to think that in our attention starved society we don't stop and actually *do* things instead of telling others that we are/will/won't be.
