    Penut's first podcast
---

Carolyn and I just got back from her 16 week appointment and I had the chance to make an audio clip of Penut's heartbeat! In the clip there are two distinct noises: The first is a stronger but slower pulse, if you listen carefully you'll also hear a faster but smaller pulse in the background. Toward the middle to end part of the clip you can hear it much easier.

<em>Ignore the title, Penut is not his/her name. Its just a nickname that Carolyn and I came up with when we first found out that she was pregnant because thats how big he/she was at the time.</em>
