    Finger hurts
---

I think i broke my finger, it really hurts. Carolyn tried very hard last night to make a doctor appointment but i didn't want to and now i regret it. figures. Aside from that things are well.

I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. We've got tickets for a 1:45 showing of Pirates 3!! This will be the first time in almost 7 months that Carolyn and I will be able to go see a movie by ourselves. Hurray!

On sunday i think we are going over to her grandparent's house for a bbq. I was told that they are going to warm up the pool too. I hope it works out that we can take Vanessa for a little swim. I wonder if she'll like it.

I don't think we have anything planned for Monday, other than sleeping late and enjoying the 3rd day of the 3 day weekend.

This morning before work i made a quick stop at the mechanic to check on Tom and was told that they'll have him ready by Tuesday or Wednesday. I will be so happy to have my car back.
