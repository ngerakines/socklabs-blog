    Leaving the self
---

<blockquote>
Heaven lasts long, and Earth abides.
What is the secret of their durability?
Is it not because they do not live for themselves
That they can live so long?
Therefore, the sage remains behind,
But stands at the head of others;
Reckons himself out,
But finds himself safe and secure.
<i>Is it not because he is selfless
That his Self is realized?</i>
 - Lao-tzu
</blockquote>

It is the quiet and dark times that often leave one to think and reflect on his or her actions. But in the darkness and void of my thoughts I ask the question: Is nothingness any less a miracle than substance?

Void is such an odd concept to most people ( myself included ). Because in my mind there is not just the endless void of space, thus I refer to it as pure emptyness, but even further and to a greater degree, the void of non-existance.

When God created the heavens and the earth, did He create the darkness and the empty as well?

Duality at its best.
