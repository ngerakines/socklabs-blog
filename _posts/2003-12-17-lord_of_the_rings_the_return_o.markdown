I had two tickets to see the midnight showing of <i>The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of the King</i> and you can be damn sure that I wasn't about to let them go to waste.I sat in my seat anxiously awaiting the third and final episode of the LOTR trillogy.

The movie was great. I loved the special effects and story line. I was very impressed. When i get more time i'll write a full review.
