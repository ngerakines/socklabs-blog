    Saturday, o blessed Saturday

This weekend has been unexplainably productive. On Friday I made some calls and arranged some apartment viewing appointments in Mountain View, so on Saturday we got up kinda early and headed south. We only actually saw 2 of the apartments that we had planned on viewing, one of which was spontaneous.

There was one described as a 'cottage' which I kinda liked, but it didn't have any real yard and was backed up against a complex. It was pretty nice and had hardwood floors but Carolyn wasn't too impressed. The other one was part of a larger complex. The outside wasn't <em>great</em> but once you stepped in the door it really opened up. I was mildly impressed.

One of the ones we didn't see was really weird to us. We had arranged to view the place at 1:00 pm and made it a minute or so early. We had talked to them 2 or 3 hours earlier and made sure it was available and ready for us to see. When we got there, the lady was acting strange and, what felt like was on a whim, said that she had rented it already. It really struck us as odd because she immediately said we could go see it still if we wanted to.

The last place was at 1:45 pm. We drove by but the surround apartments and area felt really ghetto and rundown so we left.

On our way home we stopped at Carolyn's first love, Ikea. Carolyn explained that she felt like we should wait to get a few of the things we liked because we will be moving soo soon, but we did pick up a few essentials.

Mainly boxes for old cloths and whatnot.

We made it home and made the house into something new. That really isn't an exaggeration. We spent well until 9:00 pm cleaning and organizing and the results were mind blowing. Its really amazing what a few small things can really do for you. We also did 6 loads of laundry, which included the new sheets and bedding.

We finally settled down and get ready for bed. I started watching the movie <em>Weather Man</em> but turned it off about half way through because it lost my interest.
