I was really disappointed with this one. It started off with a really strong cast and a plot that had you guessing what was going to happen next. Well, for the first 10 minutes at least. Then it just got creepy in the 'not so scary but really weird' way.

It did have a good cast and an interesting plot, so I give it a 2 out of 5. What it did lack was a non-repetitive dialog and character development.
