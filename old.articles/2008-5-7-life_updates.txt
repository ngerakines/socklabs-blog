So what has been going on lately? Well, to start of my book [Facebook Application Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470246669?ie=UTF8&tag=socklabs-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470246669) was released and is out on the shelves. I got my first copy in the mail last Monday. I'm extremely happy.

We also fired up our old [netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) account. Carolyn and I are into season 6 of [Stargate SG-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1) and up until now have been buying each season. It didn't take long to come to conclusion that, although its a really good show, we probably won't be watching it again. So the idea being that we'll just get each disk as needed. 

I've also moved to another group at work. I'm no longer on the [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) team but instead, I've moved to the team building native iPhone applications. So far its been a lot of fun and I'm excited about some pretty cool stuff we have coming out.

Not too long ago I built and launched an [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) website called [FluxHP](http://points.flux-medivh.com/view/). Its for the WoW raiding guild that I'm on and as per its description "FluxHP is a DKP/HP management system written for World of Warcraft guilds." In the (near) future I'll be releasing it as an open source project. More on that later. The site uses ErlyWeb over Yaws + Mneisa and handles raid management, user management and automatic DKP/HP decay.
