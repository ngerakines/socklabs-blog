    Crutches
---

I absolutely hate the feeling of needing help with day to day activities. Yesterday I left work early to go to the emergency room because of a really bad knee injury. It started last friday at work when I got up to my desk and while I was walking over to Garth's desk ( a whole 5 feet away ) I must of stepped wrong and my knee started hurting.

Since then its been getting worse. Sunday night it was hurting pretty bad. I woke up Monday as if nothing was wrong and when I was walking to the train station I could walk normally and it didn't hurt at all. Reality caught up very quickly because when I took a step out with my right leg I felt a very distinct 'pop' and my knee buckled and came out from under me. Subsequently I fell over and called Carolyn to let her know what happened. I was thinking about going to the ER then but convinced myself that a wrap and ice pack would do some good and decided to just go to work.

Over the course of the day it didn't get any better and I really need to be seen by a doctor. I left early after the 2pm meeting. Carolyn picked me up at the train station in Mountain View and we went strait to the ER.

Now I'm sitting at home in the rocker with my leg propped up with an ACE bandage on it. I have determined that I really don't like crutches, but right now I can't really walk.

This morning was especially painfull when I woke up in agony. There was a really tight fist-sized rock in my right leg just below the knee. It hurt to the point of tears. Carolyn rubbed it out and said it was just a really really bad cramp although I have never had one that bad before.

Tomorrow I have another doctor appointment to investigate it more and to see if I need surgery or not. I'm really not looking forward to it
