		 	<p>This is my review/rant on the movie <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. Take it lightly and correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.</p>

<p>Warning, this might contain spoilers to some people.</p>

<p>First and foremost, where was Dobby, Winky, Ludo Bagman and the blast ended skrewts? Not once did I see any of them mentioned. I kinda seems weird seeing the roles that they played. The whole skrewt story was a part of Hagrid. Also, they didn't touch the kitchens at all either. On top of that, and somewhat related, S.P.E.W. was completely left out. They also combined all of the pensive scenes which took a bit of the thrill of it out. It also looked like they really downplayed Fleur quite a bit, having only 2 or 3 lines.</p>

<p>Oh and the Beaxbauton girls' dance routine was just plain silly.</p>

<p>Another major gripe is how they portray Dumbledore. In the book he's a pretty calm and composed guy, but in the movie they potray him as worried and almost frantic.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, they also played the two guest schools as being single sex. The books made it pretty clear that they were both coed. The movie also goes out of the way to make snape look like a bad guy. In the book, it paints a picture that has snape in a different light with a bit more repsect and trust. The scene at the world cup was also a bit off. The book plays it out to be a forested area. And what was with the bathroom scene with Harry and the egg? I guess in my mind I had pictured it differently.</p>

<p>And for that matter where was Bill, Charlie and Percy? They mention them very very briefly, but it wasn't enough. And what about the Rita Skeeter story?  There was also quite a bit on Barty Crouch that was taken out as well. There were also the creatures missing from the maze and Moody getting rid of them for Harry. The movie also played Krum's role in the maze to be something as to him not keeping his witts about and that it was the maze that did it to me not the curse. That was dumb.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, they really rushed through the entire movie. Leaving huge chunks and subplots out is frustrating enough, don't speed through it too.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It was well produced and they did an excellent job on the main plot and some of the sub stories. On that note I really loved the roles of Fred and George. Those two did an excellent job and really added a lot to the movie. I think especially after the game before the death eater attack.</p>
