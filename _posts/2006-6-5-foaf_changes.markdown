    FOAF Changes
---

I'm a FOAF advocate, I won't try to hide it. With all thats changed recently and so many updates to friends and family I've updated my FOAF doc. The url hasn't changed, <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/foaf.rdf">http://blog.socklabs.com/foaf.rdf</a>, so take a look. You can also explore it using <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.socklabs.com%2Ffoaf.rdf">FOAF Explorer</a>.

I'd like to point out the very well made FOAF documents that VOX publishes as well. As far as I can tell, each user has one associated with his/her profile. They are very well formated and do contain a lot of handy information but what is better is that they hold back the xml bloat. Here is an example: <a href="http://ngerakines.vox.com/profile/foaf.rdf">http://ngerakines.vox.com/profile/foaf.rdf</a>.
