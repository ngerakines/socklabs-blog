    Not so much Wow lately
---

For the past 4 days nearly every time that I sign onto Medivh I log back off about 10 minutes later. Last night and this morning Vanessa was fussy. She woke up several times throughout the night and had a real hard time getting back to sleep. My suspicion is that it is gas.

In a few days the big wow expansion, The Burning Crusade, will hit the stores. I'm super excited about it and I think that Carolyn is too. There is a collector's edition but after looking up the prices it is over $200 and totally not worth it. I'm not <i>that</i> into the game.
