    Car in the shop

I'm really glad that it stopped raining, at least for the time being. Yesterday I brought the mustang over to the shop at the end of the street to get a work estimate. I'm pretty glad that he's finally over there and that he'll get some much needed attention. The list of what needs to be done is pretty big and it won't be cheap, but it needs to be done. I've been putting it off for a while.
