So far:

 * Flew down to Los Angeles on friday afternoon.
 * Went strait to the <em>Henry Fonda Music Box</em> for the Mutaytor show.
 * Hung out back stage with the cast and crew.
 * Carolyn saw her first Mutaytor show, it fucking rocked.
 * Went to Eric's place and crashed about 3:00 am.
 * Woke up, got breakfast, rented a u-hual truck.
 * Packed and closed out the storage unit on Glendale Blvd.
 * Drove up to the desert, traffic wasn't so bad.
 * Picked up the Grand Am from Chelsea's house.
 * I have my surf board back!

Now:
 * Both the cajone and tahachapi are closed because of a freak snow storm.
 * Snow locked in Victorville
 * Staying at a hotel, just took a shower.

Good night world.
