    So much for that
---

So I made the comment in a previous post about being 'offline' for the next few days while I am out of town for Thanksgiving. Ha! It must of been the sugar high speaking because of all places and times it isn't here or now.

We checked into our room at the <a href="http://www.bellagiolasvegas.com/">Bellagio</a> around 8p and after getting settled Carolyn and I headed down to the buffet on the casino floor. If you've never been there before the first thing you see is a $30 per plate buffet price but when you head into the dining hall there is just row after row of food. Soooo much food.

Over the next few days we have a lot in store. I think there is going to be a lot of shopping and I'm going to try to get a haircut and a shave. Tomorrow Carolyn is going to the spa and in the evening we are going out to dinner and then to see <a href="http://www.mandalaybay.com/entertainment/mamma_mia.aspx">Mamma Mia</a>. On Friday we will be seeing <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/love/intro/intro.htm">Beatles: Love</a> too. Between the shows and hotel tours, we definitely have our days filled.

I've taken some pictures but I'm really trying not to go overboard like some of tourist we've seen. A flickr set will follow.
