I picked up an isight today and am really ready to get back into videocasting and podcasting. I made my obligatory first videocast and used a really cool plugin called <a href="http://brandon.fuller.name/archives/hacks/mtenclosures/">MTEnclosures</a> to publish the enclosures in my rss feed.

I'm going to really try to make every 3rd or so post a video or audio post so subscribe to <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/index.xml">my feed</a> in iTunes and keep tuned.
