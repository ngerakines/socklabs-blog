    MT Hack-a-thon
---

I won't be able to attend, although I wish I could, but there is going to be a MT hack-a-thon this coming Tuesday. This is great for not only the seasoned MT users, developers and contributors but what they aren't advertising is that if you developer for any of the other blogging systems (wordpress, drupal, etc) and want to port your plugins over to one of the most popular enterprise blogging platforms in the world than this is your chance to rub shoulders with people who can help you best.

Go. Hack.
