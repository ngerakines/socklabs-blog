    GMail for Domains
---

Woke up this morning to find some very cool news. Google has launched a service dubbed 'GMail for Domains' which allows you to provide personalized email under your own domain(s). I for one find that very very cool. It is also kinda scary to think that all of your email is now going to be read, scanned and stored by Google.

Maybe this is just the thing that would allow me to move some of the web services on this host to a dedicated host and not have to worry about email.

I suspect that a service like this requires some DNS tweaking, but since it is Google they probably have a configuration generator for the top 50 DNS servers.

I really wonder how Yahoo feels about this. If Google is going to be providing this sort of thing for free, then Yahoo's paid service is going to get hit pretty hard.

In closing, these are some cool things that I'd like to see from this service, but don't expect: The ability to host multiple domains. The ability to tie a domain email address to your gmail account. The ability to do catchall and forwards.
