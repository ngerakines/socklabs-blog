I've got my main char on that server up to lvl 20 and so far I've got 130+/- honor kills. Carolyn and I have been playing a lot lately and its been a lot of fun. Well, a lot of fun and a total time suck, but that is expected. I think that with all of the chugging and pushing at work, the brain-dump that is WoW really helps me unwind a little.

Back in the real world .. Today was fun. We just got back from eating at 'Fresh Choice' and I'm going to be doing laundry and preparing for the following few days of hacking and planning. Vanessa has been doing much better and things are really good for me right now. I've got a ton of stuff to do. To bad there aren't more hours in the day.
