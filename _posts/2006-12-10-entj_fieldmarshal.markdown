    ENTJ -- Fieldmarshal
---

I took a <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/default.asp">myers-briggs test</a> and it said that my myers-briggs personality type is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENTJ">ENTJ</a> "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldmarshal_(Role_Variant)">Fieldmarshal</a>". I took the same test a while ago and was told that it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP">INTP</a> "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect_(Role_Variant)">Architect</a>" which different in a lot of ways. Carolyn took the same test and her type is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENFP">ENFP</a> "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_(Role_Variant)">Champion</a>" which I can easily see.

This is one of those types of things that would be interesting to do once a year or so and see how life experience and affects who you are (or at least how you see yourself).
