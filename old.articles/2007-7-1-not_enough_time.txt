    Not enough time
---

There are too few hours in the day. This weekend was great (for me at least) because we got a new toy. No, not a fancy new iPhone like the rest of the country. We got a Wii!

Carolyn and I finally got one after a sizable amount of searching (read as wiisearching). Once we got it we realized that we would need an additional controller so we headed off to Frys. Somehow we managed to leave with only one new game each as well as the additional controller. We agreed on Mario Party 8 and Zelda: Twilight Princess. Mario Party 8 is a blast! We played for several hours on Saturday and Sunday.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play Zelda because I can't increase the brightness of my TV. During some setup/config process it says to increase the TV brightness so that several shapes appear. Well, with the brightness to 100% there was still nothing so I suspect that my TV just might not be good enough. Looks like we'll have to get a new one. Shucks.

Wii Sports is also a lot of fun too. I especially like Bowling, Baseball and Tennis. Boxing I like the least, followed by Golf. I really really suck at Golf.

I wonder if there are any Mii Facebook Apps?
