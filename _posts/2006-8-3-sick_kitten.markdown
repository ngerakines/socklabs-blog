    Sick kitten

This morning Carolyn told me that she went to move Melee off of her lap and he bit her pretty hard. We both that it was because he has worms and she rub him the wrong way but I asked that she take them to the vet as soon as possible and she agreed that it was a good idea. A little while later she called crying to tell me that Melee has F<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_infectious_peritonitis">eline Infectious Peritonitis</a>, a fatal and incurable disease that affects cats. I'm really sad. She went further to explain all that is going on and about the tests that we are waiting to hear back on. If it is true then we are going to have to put Melee to sleep.
