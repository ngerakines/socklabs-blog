		 	<p>The third day of my trip was another late starting day to the northshore. We made tentative plans to meet grandmother again around 11:00 am but didn't really wake up until 11:45 am to find the keys missing. It wasn't until nearly 1:30 pm that we finally made it to her house.</p>

<p>The purpose of this morning trip was to help her with her computer. I gave her a brief introduction to <a href="http://thedavidsonfamily.org/">her website</a>, email and flickr. She's quite tech savvy. It wasn't long until she made a test post and put a few pictures on flickr to see how it works.</p>

<p>Carolyn and I were feeling quite hungry so we went to waffle house for some food. There I ran into TJ, an old friend. He kinda gave me a fill in on some of the old gang from MHS. Some things never really change.</p>

<p>A large portion of the day was running to K-Mart and The Home Depot for some supplies. I thought cleaning and fixing his toilet would be decent payment for letting me stay at his place over the weekend. We also went to starbucks to go online. That is where I had the chance to post the pictures that I'd taken so far to flickr and the blog posts from the past few nights.</p>

<p>A bit later we made to Covington and had dinner at Cicily's Pizza and went to Books-A-Million to kill some time. We both were quite amazed at how boring mandeville and covington had both become.</p>

<p>Back to grandmother's house to shower and help setup christmas stuff. I helped her with more computer stuff, we both took showers, and then helped setup the christmas tree and decorations. Most importantly I show her what podcasts were and after a bit of time she was looking through the podcast directory on iTunes and subscribing to the ones she liked. By then I was really starting to become impressed.</p>

<p>Home we went after a dissappointing shrug-off by emily. We cleaned and put new sheets on the bed and now here we are. She's watching lost, I'm writing, both of us mutually tired.</p>
