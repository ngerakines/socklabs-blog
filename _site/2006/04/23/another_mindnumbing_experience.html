		 	<p>I don't like hospitals or doctors. For me at least. I don't have any problem whatsoever taking someone else or helping as long as its not me. Take this past friday as an example.</p>

<p>For a while I've had a random nerve pinch problem near my heart. I've been to the ER 3 separate times and each time they've run different tests with the same outcome and prescription: Nothing is wrong, stretch more and take some vicodin. Great. Thanks. Big help.</p>

<p>So for the past few days its been really hurting and I told Carolyn on Friday morning that if it hurt any more we would go to the ER because she was worried about me. While I was at work later that day it really started to hurt and I called to tell her. She had to drop her plans with a friend who was in town but she did come by the office to pick me up.</p>

<p>We went to Stanford Medical Center ER and checked in right about 4:50 pm. After a <em><strong>4 hour wait</strong></em> I was admitted and they took a chest x-ray and an EKG to send me off with a prescription and no real answer as to what is going on.</p>

<p>Great. Once again the american healthcare system has proven its worth to me.</p>

<p>By the time we left both Carolyn and I were real pissy. Carolyn was frustrated with me for various reasons, all my fault and I admit as legitimate. I was pissed because [a] I HATE doctor visits for myself [b] I HATE emergency rooms more [c] I waited 4 hours to get the exact same result as last time. In all truth and honesty it feels like going was a waste of time. For Carolyn's sake it did rule out a lot of possible things and I did get a real prescription for the pain. She was the one who had to drop plans with an old friend for it and for that I truly am sorry.</p>
