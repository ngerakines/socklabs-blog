Thank you <a href="http://markpasc.org/">Mark</a> for giving me a rundown on OpenID and how to integrate it with MT. I'm happy to say that you can now login with an OpenID compatible account ( like LiveJournal or TypePad/TypeKey) to comment on this blog.

With that said, I decided a few days ago to start placing heavy restrictions on comments and will allow comments on select posts.

I'm learning more about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and FOAF and I have a few things planned for development.
