    Starcraft and the big WoW
---

I'll admit, since I started using my mac I have been gaming less. A good spindoctor would be able to turn that into 'Macs make me more productive and I don't even realize it, therefore I game less'. I, however, will just leave it at that. Isn't because the games aren't available, because nearly all of the games I like are available to me. Starcraft, Neverwinter Nights, World of Warcraft, Majesty, etc. The only two that aren't available are Imperium Galactica and Alpha Centauri.

Over the past few days I've discovered some interesting things. Blizzard released an intel/ppc client for Starcraft and the game plays great. That made me very happy. I've also installed World of Warcraft on my Macbook Pro and I can honestly say that I've never played it on such a nice machine. The graphics and performance are amazing.
