As requested by my grandmother, Elizabeth, I've setup a very basic site for the Davidson family. The site is <a href="http://www.thedavidsonfamily.org">TheDavidsonFamily.org</a>. It should finish its dns cycle by tomorrow morning at the very latest and I'll notify her tomorrow and see what exactly she wants to do with it. I would <strong>absolutely love</strong> to have a feed of what the family is up to and doing. Maybe its a distant fantasy though.

I hate to admit it but two of the domains that I was hosting fell through the cracks and were overlooked for a while. Aside from the data loss, they are back up and running. They will both take a bit of effort to bring back 100% but there is no doubt that it can be done.

I'll have to contact Ryan, Paul or Tiffany about doing something with <a href="http://www.montelepre.org">Montelepre.org</a>. I'll also have to talk to Alma about her domain, <a href="http://www.agepfordrdcdemnt.com">AGepfordrdcdemnt.com</a>.
