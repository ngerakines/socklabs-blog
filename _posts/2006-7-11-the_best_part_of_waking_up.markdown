    The best part of waking up
---

Is finding a kitten sound asleep on your chest. Last night was Picasso and Melee's first night at home and it went very well. We found that Melee likes to get under the covers and curl up right at your leg and conks out almost immediately. Picasso, on the other hand, ends up snuggling down right at your neck and gets up from time to time. I love kittens. I especially love how they use the scratching post and litter box right away.

On a side note, dinner was nice. Sharon, Melissa, Carolyn and I went to this nice italian restaurant on El Camino.

Yesterday I read someone's comment on Pirates 2 and it went something like "The best part of pirates 2 was the transformers preview." I wish I could disagree. The Transformers trailer made the entire audience clap and shout almost immediately. I'm really looking forward to that one.
