Friday was a good start for the weekend as we saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0376994/">X-Men: The Last Stand</a> at Shoreline. It wasn't superb by any means, but it had good action, decent acting and some nice special effects. It did deviate heavily from the old comic book plot but that is expected.

Saturday wasn't so bad: We did some shopping, the car got an oil change and then dinner with some friends.

Sunday, like Saturday, I slept late. Around noon I got a call from the optomotrist and left briefly to pick up my new glasses. There was a parade on Castro Street in Mountain view, couldn't exactly make out what it was for though. I think later today we are going to go play pool and finishing watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0107614/">Mrs. Doubtfire</a>.
