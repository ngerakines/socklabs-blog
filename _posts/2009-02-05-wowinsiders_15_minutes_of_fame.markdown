title: WoWInsider's 15 Minutes of Fame
---

Recently I was featured on WoW Insider in their [15 minutes of fame column](http://www.wowinsider.com/category/15-minutes-of-fame/). It was a great chance to talk about and express some of my thoughts and ideas on I Play WoW, social networks, World of Warcraft and mixing the three.

[The article](http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/02/04/15-minutes-of-fame-i-play-wow-for-facebook/) can be found on [their blog](http://www.wowinsider.com/).
