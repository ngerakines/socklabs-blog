    The Wedding Crashers
---

Carolyn and I picked this up last night on our way home from making groceries. This movie was funny and light hearted. It keeps you laughing through the entire stretch of the plot and has a good, positive tone. The basic plot is that John ( Owen Wilson ) and Jeremy ( Vince Vaughn ) are good friends and have been for the longest time. They also make a hobby out of womanizing and sneak into weddings to take advantage of the romantic thoughts and curiosities of the guests who are there. After doing this for a while John meets Claire ( Rachel McAdams ) and Jeremy meets Gloria ( Isla Fisher ).

It wouldn't be funny if that was the end of it. Claire and Gloria are both daughters of Treasury Secretary William Cleary ( Christopher Walken ) and John finds out that Claire is in a relationship. Jeremy also finds out that Gloria is mental.

No spoilers here, go see the movie. Its worth the 5$ spent on it at blockbuster.
