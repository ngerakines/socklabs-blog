    The late train
---

This morning I tugged and fought with myself to get out of bed on time and eventually lost the battle. The 2 extra hours of sleep really worked wonders and I feel much better than I have been. Amazing what a little extra sleep will do for the body and mind.

The train ride has been very pleasant. On the way home last night I checked the mail and found that my first issue of Science News arrived. Garth had recommended it to me not too long ago and figured that a subscription would be worth the risk.

Work is moving along. The TypePad developers have been really busting out code to prepare for some earth moving changes and I really think that Garth, Paul and Mark have done an outstanding job. I think everyone will be quite happy when it is all said and done. I've also had the chance to meet a few of the rojo guys and they really seem like great people. I'm looking forward to working with them.
