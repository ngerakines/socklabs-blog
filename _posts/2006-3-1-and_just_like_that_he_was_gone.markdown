    And just like that, he was gone

This morning was really hard for me. I drove Tom over to Oakland and put him away. I don't know how long it will be but it makes me sad to think about it. I love my car, I've had some of the best times of my life with it.

There was a moment of karma this morning as I was getting gas. The tank went over and a huge amount of gas went all over my pants. This day has been rough.
