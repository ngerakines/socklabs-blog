Some pretty major changes have been made to the taxonomy system recently. All of the different term trees have been migrated into one tree to fit general types. You might notice that many of the older posts won't have taxonomy associated with them any more. This is a work in progress.

I'd also like to announce the creation of <a href="http://montelepre.org">Montelepre.org</a>. There isn't anything up at the primary site but <a href="http://tiffany.montelepre.org">Tiffany</a> and <a href="http://jamie.montelepre.org">Jamie</a> already have there subdomains up and going.
