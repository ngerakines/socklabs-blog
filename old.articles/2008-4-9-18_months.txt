    18 months

This morning we took Vanessa to her 18 month checkup. Because we held back on one of her 12 month shots, she had to get one today. She measured in to the 20% percentile for her height and weight, but growth has been steady. She's just a little small :).

She's doing really well and is definitely growing. She absolutely loves Barney and is starting to get into all sorts of trouble by climbing over things, opening things and generally asserting what she does or does *not* want. I'm very happy.

Recently we took her to the Toys-R-Us in Sunnyvale to see Barney in person. It was a lot of fun for her and you could see the absolute amazement and happiness of giving him a great big (well as big as she can make it) hug. In fact, while we were trying to take pictures she just wouldn't turn around -- she was too busy trying to hold him. It was cute.
