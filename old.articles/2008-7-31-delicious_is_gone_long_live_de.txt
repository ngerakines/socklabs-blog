    Delicious is gone! Long live Delicious!
---

The Delicious team at Yahoo has been hard at work for *over a year* working on a complete overhaul of the system and I'm so very proud and happy to announce that their hard work has payed off this week. Delicious has launched it's 2.0 version including a very slick site redesign. Delicious, in its former state, was a huge Perl application on top of Apache and MySQL. Since then, its been completely recreated in a tiered system with quite a bit of PHP and c++ with Erlang sprinkled around in various places.

I can't count the number of features and internals that have been completely overhauled for performance. There are also several new really cool, and much needed, features. As trivial as it may seem, my all-time favorite is the ability to create aliases for people in your network. No longer do I need to see "b3d0u1n" on my network page or inbox, but now "Mark Zweifel". Hurray

So, congratulations to everyone in the Delicious group and who supported them! Today is a great day.
