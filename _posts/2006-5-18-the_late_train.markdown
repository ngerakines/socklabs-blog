    The late train
---

I'm on the late train again. I woke up this morning feeling my cell phone on my chest and saw that the time was nearing 9:00 am. That means that I barely missed the 8:59 am train and will have to catch the 9:29 am train.

The past few days have been tough. On both Monday and Tuesday I had appointments at the dentist office. They did a 'deep cleaning' but split it into two visits. I was a bit apprehensive at first but soon realized that the pain really struck not during the visit but several hours later when your body has a real chance to figure out how sore it is.

I also finished and release 0.6 of Fence (TypePad-Uploader). This is a pretty big release in that it has some major bug fixes and also some major feature additions as well. Read the latest entry in the <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/typepad-uploader/">project blog</a> for more information.

In my spare time I've been reading the book 'American Gospel' by Jon Meacham and I think it is brilliant. I'm only about half-way through but it has served as an excellent recap of the political struggle of religion in this country.

At SixApart we've been very busy lately. I've been working on a few big features that may go unnoticed by the general public, but to some out there they will greatly be appreciated.
