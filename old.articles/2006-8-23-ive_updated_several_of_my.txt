    CPAN Updates
---

I've updated several of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/">my cpan modules</a> lately and added a new one (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Apache-Session-Generate-UUID">Apache-Session-Generate-UUID</a>). A few weeks ago I created a new svn repos and trac area for my cpan modules and other open source perl projects. Its not very big right now but it is publicly available if anyone wants to see the status of my open source projects and/or file a ticket with one of them.
