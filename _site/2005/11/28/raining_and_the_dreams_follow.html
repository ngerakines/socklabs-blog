		 	<p>I've got a sore throat that is pretty bad. Thankfully <a href="http://carolyn.socklabs.com/">Carolyn</a> kicks soo much ass that she decided to buy me an early christmas present which happens to be a heating blanket. I can't even begin to say how much I love this thing. There was a funny moment last night during the drive when I realized that I had more blankets and pillows in my car than in my house. I found it quite amusing.</p>

<p>Looking forward to work tomorrow, we have a lot going on. Been reading <a href="http://fuzzyblog.wordpress.com">Fuzzyblog</a> and see that the <a href="http://top500.feedster.com/">feedster top500</a> is creating a good bit of buzz. Scott has been working around the clock at getting that thing going and running smoothly. I also saw a preview of the working new ui and its looking really hot. Can't wait for it.</p>

<p>While I was down in SoCal, and bored out of my mind, I picked up a copy of StarCraft and have been playing a good bit. If the net connection wasn't so fuzzy I would of been playing WoW. Starcraft is a classic though, one of those games you never really forget. For that matter I really miss playing Imperium Galactica and Majesty too.</p>

<p>I also talked to both Corey and Cassidy today. It was nice talking with Corey and catching up. He is in Stockton for the time being and thought he'd say hi. Next time I'm down in Los Angeles I'm going to make sure I stop by the old place and say hi. I also got word that Sterling is moving up to Cananda and Chris is moving into a loft in downtown LA. Even better, I heard that Corey is moving up to San Francisco. That'd rock.</p>

<p>Brent also called and we caught up. He said he's not doing to well. We both got a laugh out of the fact that when he closed his register at the bar today, he did a total of 47 in sales. I couldn't get over the fact that in the French Quarter on a weekend they did a total of 47$. He confessed that come spring, he's going to get out of there and run the trails like he's been wanting too. I say good for him, he could use some cheer.</p>
