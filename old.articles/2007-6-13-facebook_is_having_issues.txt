    Facebook is having issues
---

Every site has growing pains and Facebook isn't any different. Last night / Yesterday they did a platform push and there are reports all over the developer forums about apps not responding and facebook going generally slow. Fun times.

For the users of del.icio.us, I Play Wow and Egotags: Its not me. My server has low load and memcache, mysql and apache are all at happy levels. Give it time and things will return to normal.
