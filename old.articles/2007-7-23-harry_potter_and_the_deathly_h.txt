Carolyn came home with two copies of the latest, and last, book in the Harry Potter series around 2 am Saturday morning. She and a friend went to see the movie and then pick up a midnight edition at the Borders near the movie theater in Santana Row. With my business lately it was nice to see her get some time to herself. Time that didn't involve Vanessa OR myself for that matter. Everyone needs a break sometimes.

We started reading together and by 1:15 on Sunday morning I finished the last chapter and was off to bed. She had already finished a bit earlier in the day, but she had spent consider amount of time reading while I was sleeping in on Saturday morning.

What do I think about it? In general I liked the book. I like it a lot. I was quite pleased with the way it turned out and I think the author did an excellent job at closing up the plot. If there is never another Harry Potter book, which I think holds true, it'll be OK because there aren't a ton of questions that need answering. If you havn't read it, go pick up a copy. Its worth the time.
