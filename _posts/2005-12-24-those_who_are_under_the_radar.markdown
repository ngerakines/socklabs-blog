Well, the christmas break is a time set aside for many to stop and relax. To break out the leg rests and have a thoughtless seat by the fire, so to speak. This is not true for some.

Good friend <a href="http://fuzzyblog.com">Scott</a> seems to have <a href="http://www.ookles.com/">something in the skunkworks</a>. I havn't had the chance to talk to him because I've been playing <i>The Sims</i> instead of churning out code, but I'd love to get his take on what he's got in store for us.
