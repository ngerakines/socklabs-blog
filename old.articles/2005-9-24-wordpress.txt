Since I'm going to be starting from near script with my blog again, I decided to give Wordpress a try. I met Matt at a conference recently and his product doesn't seem so bad. We'll see how long it lasts against the spam hoarde out there.

If you have any good plugin suggestions or ideas for this blog please let me know. I'm not really sure what Wordpress is capable of, so pipe in with some ideas.
