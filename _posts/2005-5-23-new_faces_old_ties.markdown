This weekend started rough when I landed on my leg wrong and tore the ligament in my left knee. After a silly experience at the hospital they said I had a minor, aka small, stress fracture and tore the ligament. What can you do. This all happened Wednesday evening after heading home from Orange. Kinda figures really. I was walking down the stairs to my house and my foot slipped on a step and landed flat on the next one. Once that happened I immediately felt something was off. I crashed out pretty hard and woke up hurting and took something for it. The next day at work was bad and ended up leaving early.

The rest of the weekend wasn't bad I guess. Saturday was mom's graduation at Chapman. The entire family came out, save a few, and it was great. So rare do we have such events that the entire family can come to and appreciate. That was soon over, around noon or so, and the party at my aunt's house wasn't until 6p. So we had some time to kill.

The party that evening went very well. We had some of her friends over, as well as the family, and ate and drank. It was a lot of fun.

On Sunday I picked up a new friend, who still needs pictures and an introduction, and her name is Wendy. She's only about 10 weeks and has short grey hair.

The rest of the week looks dull. Nothing going on the entire week save Tuesday. Everyone flies out on Tuesday except for my dad who leaves tonight.

For me its back to work. I missed Friday because of my leg and fear I'm going to hear it.
