    Erlyflux going into the freezer
---

A while ago I started a project called ErlyFlux. The goal was to create a suite of web apps for World of Warcraft guilds to manage and integrate things like a forum, wiki, dkps, calendar and so forth. In the end it was working really well for our guild and all was good.

Carolyn and I aren't in that guild anymore and they decided that they didn't want to trouble us with hosting the stuff for them and moved to their own, much simpler, forum. Thats all fine and good and no feelings were damaged in the process. Without the guild using it however, the project started to become stagnant and didn't get much development time.

With that said, I'm taking it off of github and posting project's source code as-is. If your guild is interested in using it please contact me for setup and admin information. I'd like to continue development on an as-needed basis but it has a pretty low priority as of right now.
