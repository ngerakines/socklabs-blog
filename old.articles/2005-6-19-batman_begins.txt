    Batman Begins
---

Batman Begins suprised me in many ways. Aside from its kin like `Batman and Robin` and the joke that is `Catwoman`, this movie stood out because of its excellent progression of character and plot. For 2 hours and 14 minutes I absorbed every bit of this film and all that it could give.

Let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the comics. The few Batman episodes that I've seen many years ago were nice if not cheesy. This movie however made me a fan. Christian Bale did an excelent job of acting out the depth of Batman's true character. I acredit him with transforming Batman into the once thought playboy to the depressed bruce wayne searching for truth and solace from his inner guilt. It explored the persona of a dark and desperate man looking for answers and eventually finding them.
