    Christmas day is coming to an end
---

Dinner is almost ready and that means that christmas day is coming to a close. It has been a most wonderful day and I'm glad that I had the chance to spend it with family. I didn't get to see anyone from down south and I miss them a lot, but I did at least get to call and wish everyone a happy holiday.

I don't have any set plans for this week but I think Carolyn and I are going to bring Vanessa to the doctor. She's been coughing an awful lot and she's been generally fussy. Carolyn hasn't been feeling too well either and I think she has a doctor appointment later in the week.

I've posted a few pictures to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock/sets/72157594426617839/">Christmas 2006 photo set</a> and there are a few more that I'd like to post that I'll get to once we are home and settled. I think the agenda for tonight is dinner and then giving Melissa a tour of WoW and seeing if she is interested. I've already made one trip home and back with a carload of stuff and I think I'll have to make at least two more to bring everything.
