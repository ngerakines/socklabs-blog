    A New Year
---

And I'm already 3 days late posting! Happy New Year!

Looking back at 2006 is just plain scary. I got married, moved into a place together, my daughter was born, started at Yahoo... Its been the most wonderful and hectic time of my life. I don't even know where to begin. Maybe I'll keep this post short and bullet through what is going on.

I've posted more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sock/sets/72157594426617839/">christmas pictures</a>.

Made lots of updates to <a href="http://www.infanttracker.com/">InfantTracker</a>.

Updated Cocoa-AtomAPIClient and Fence</a>.

Got back into crunch mode for the next Delicious milestone.

I've been plowing through several books lately. More on them later.
