		 	<p>The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/developers/verified_app_interest.php">Application Verification Process</a> was announced today and at first I thought it was a joke. Here's why:</p>

<p><strong>The benefits are vague and misleading.</strong> In the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/verification.php">verification FAQ</a> it mentions two different types of benefits but not together. One part says that verified applications get a special badge displayed on the application's about page as well as priority listing in the application directory. Another part of the FAQ mentions an increased number of notifications and requests. Both of these areas also mention a $100 advertising credit but honestly that's like giving bottled water to a fish.</p>

<p><strong>What qualifies is extremely vague and very subjective.</strong> When describing the program in the official verification FAQ, they list gems like "Applications should be Meaningful" and "Applications should be Trustworthy." They don't mention anything about the review process or who actually reviews the applications submitted. It could be one person who doesn't like specific things and judges applications with a particular bias. Then again, it could be an extremely lazy process that blindly allows applications that at least look 'OK', however it is defined. For all we know, there could be no review process at all and in the end, it's nothing more than a suped up advertising scheme. This brings us to the next point, fees.</p>

<p><strong>There's a $375 non-refundable processing fee.</strong> Seriously? You have to pay a processing fee up-front with initial submission then wait for an email, for up to two weeks, telling you the application will be processed and at that point you'll have to provide more information for the verification process. More information, as said in the FAQ, includes screenshots and detailed descriptions of the application's components and parts. If your application does not pass this verification process then the processing fee you paid is lost. Furthermore, if Facebook finds any issue with your application regarding it's terms of service you may face a penalty. The best part about it is that your verified status lasts only up to one year. Each year you have to go through the same process, all over again.</p>

<p>The Application Verification Process is nothing more than a cheesy marketing scheme. Instead of innovating and paving the way in the social space, they've resorted to accepting bribes for product placements. I'm disappointed in you, Facebook.</p>
