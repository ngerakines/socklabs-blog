    He's Back!
---

Its been a long time but I finally have my '65 mustang back. Its been sitting in a lot collecting dust for the past 10 months or so and I think its real happy to be back in the action. It was unfortunate that it got to this but while I was living in Orange I just couldn't handle the gas milliage while commuting to and from Santa Monica every day. But now that I've been living in LA for a while and things feel pretty stable at home and work it feels right again.

I was a bit suprised to find that it started right away. The battery needed to be recharged but aside from that it was in great condition. It needs a good bit of work but I finally have the time, and money, to get at it. The engine and transmission are in excellent condition and thats going to make a big difference in the long run.

I think I'm going to stick with its original color scheme of a white body and red interior. I think that a cleverly placed racing stripe wouldn't be a bad thing though.

Needless to say, I am joyful. I've not been this happy in quite some time now.
