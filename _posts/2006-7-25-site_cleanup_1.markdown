    Site cleanup

Its that time again, time to clean up the blog. So far I've cleaned up some of the templates used in and around the site and made some back-end changes. The back-end changes include updating the KeywordExtractor plugin used to auto-generate tags and keywords as well as tweaking the build cycle. I also cleaned up a good bit of spam. More information later... Well maybe.
