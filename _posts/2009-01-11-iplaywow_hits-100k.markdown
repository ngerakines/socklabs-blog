title: I Play WoW hits 100k users
---

I'm really really excited to say that I Play WoW has officially crossed the 100,000 user line. I knew it was getting close and have been checking it every few hours, so about 20 minutes ago I hopped onto Facebook and saw that it happened. The official count was at 100,039 as of 11:45. I think it is the only Facebook application out there with over 100,000 users that is 100% Erlang. Go Erlang!
