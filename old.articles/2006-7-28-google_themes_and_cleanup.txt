    Google, themes and cleanup

There has been quite a bit going on with my website lately. Over the past 2 years my traffic has been growing by leaps and bounds and to be honest I'm kind of surprised. This is just a personal blog where I rant about whatever is bothering me and talk about my wife, daughter and cat(s). It really isn't anything super special. There is much truth with the saying '<i>if you build it they will come</i>'. At least on the internet that is.

The most visible change is the theme changes on the <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/keywordextractor/">Keyword Extractor</a> and <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/typepad-uploader/">Fence</a> project blogs. Thanks to <a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/">The Style Contest</a>, there are a ton of 'drop-in-css' themes available. Many of them are really nice and nearly all of them unique. I even heard that it will be a permanent fixture, like a styles and themes archive, but still have the annual contest. That makes me very happy.

The main site (<a href="http://www.socklabs.com/">http://www.socklabs.com/</a>) also received a new theme. The one that I was using was stretching text and I didn't like the way it handled some images. It was a simple change that worked really well.

I've got webalizer running nightly and it isn't bad, but the information that Google Analytics can give me is much more detailed. I also took the opportunity to make sure that all of the blogs have valid Google sitemaps.

Lastly, the atom feeds used throughout the site have been updated and are now completely valid Atom 1.0 feeds. Yay standards!
