    Carolyn's new toy
---

Yesterday we went out to Bed, Bath and Beyond to pick up a few things for the house and while we were there we went over to Best Buy to walk around. While we were there Carolyn decided to use a gift card that she got for her birthday on a pink Nintendo DS Lite.

A while ago we I got her a PSP which seemed like a good idea at the time but it started collecting dust. The PSP is a good 'idea' but I really think they let it sit too long with too few games and movies that are too expensive.

Getting a DS was a good idea. The games are really fun and addicting and they are pretty cheap as well. The DS itself is cute, light, small, cheap and fun. Its probably one of the best entertainment systems I've used in a long time. I can't wait for the Wii.
