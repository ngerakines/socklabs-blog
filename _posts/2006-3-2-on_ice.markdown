Yeah, you read that correctly. I will admit though, surprisingly it was a lot of fun. The place was kinda ghetto and there were screaming 6 year olds everywhere, but it was good. They really did an excellent job with the set and costume design. We even got cheesy souvenirs.

I think we are going to watch <em>Lost</em> and call it a day. Ohh, to make the day even better, while I was on my way home from work I saw a pirate ship in the bay.
