    January in a Nutshell
---

This is January in a nutshell. I'm back from the good ole air force and living with my beloved girlfriend. Things are looking up and life is getting better. Christmas was 'fun' to say the least. I'm job hunting, if any recruiters are seeing this, and wanting to go back into school.

As for my site i have a lot more time to devote to it. I'm completely redoing the d&d engine and how its done. Also i am starting on converting the site from an access based database to xml dom. That'll be a very fun and long process.

Anywho, everyone have fun and wish me luck in starting over my life.
