title: Protocol Buffers and Pygments
---

I've been working on a small Protocol Buffers definition file parser for [Pygments](http://pygments.org/). It's a work in progress and at this point it only supports a very limited number of tokens and features. This is being developed to help the documentation effort for a Protocol Buffers based API that I've been working on.
