    Good Food, Good Company

Last night there was a techie dinner at Chaat ( 3rd and Folsom ) hosted by <a href="http://fuzzyblog.com">Scott Johnson</a>. There was a pretty good turn out and we all had a good time. I met some cool people for the first time and got to hang out with some old friends.

I took some pictures of the event ( and found more proof that I need a better camera ) and some of the other guests took pictures as well.
