    Day 1 - The Arrival
---

Our second day in the city started at noon. On the night before we went to the <i>spotted cat</i> off of frenchman and listened to some really good cajun jazz performed by <i>Gypsy Blue</i> and had some good Abita Springs beer.

That was a great night. We were going to stay at Brent's place in the heart of the french quarter. We meet him at his pub and then wandered over to <i>Cafe du monde</i> to have some coffee to break in the night. It wasn't long before we were dropping off our bags and set out to have some fun.

I have to confess that I've never seen that place so dull and empty. Brent described it quite well when he said that the quarter was <b>desolate</b>. There were some people, but very very few. Brent admitted that one of the most disturbing things he's ever seen as a New Orleans tour guide, was a group of military police patrolling bourbon street. There were police and soldiers everywhere. It felt almost unreal.

Our actual flight into the city was about an hour later, so when we landed it was dark and pretty much stuck to I-10. The surrounding area immediately around Brent's place and the french quarter didn't seem that bad. It wasn't until the next day that we really saw how entire neighborhoods were wiped off of the map.
