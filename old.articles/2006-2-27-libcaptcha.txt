<a href="http://libcaptcha.tigris.org/">libcaptcha</a> is a library to create captchas. It provides a layer of abstraction between image creation and manipulation libraries to provide a simple interface for the creation, manipulation and validation of captchas.

Development is going really really well and I've already got a working demo that generates captchas using some of the presets. There is also documentation and example code, so go play around.
