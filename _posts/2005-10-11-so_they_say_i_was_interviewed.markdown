A co-worked pulled me aside today and told me that I was quoted in a piece on the Silcon Valley Watcher. For those who are curious, this is the link: <a href="http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/10/and_talking_of.php">http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/10/and_talking_of.php</a>. Its nothing big or special, but its in relation to ping servers and the feedmesh.
