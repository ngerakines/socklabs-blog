    Busy weekend
---

This weekend I've been on a roll. On Friday evening I spent 2 hours to design, develop and released wrsd, a World of Warcraft realm monitoring daemon. In a nutshell, it serves xml representing the status and state of an individual realm. This information includes the name, whether it is up or down, the realm type and current population/load.

Saturday afternoon I wrote an iPhone application that uses the realm data provided by wrsd. It really needs some user-interface love but the basic functionality is done. It allows you to select a realm from a list and once selected saves that realm in the application configuration. When the application is opened it displays the realm status for the realm that was last selected.

Today I'm planning on making a few updates to FluxHP. I've got a companion application called FluxEM that I'll be checking in as well.
