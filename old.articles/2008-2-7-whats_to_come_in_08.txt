    Whats to come in 0.8
---

<p>Release 0.8 is coming up and I've got some fairly significant changes in store. The first is category selection. Now in addition to listing your blogs and galleries, it'll also retrieve the categories available to each blog and allow you to have new entries (text and/or media) automatically categorized as they are posted. This way you can categorize quick posts under 'quick notes' or images under 'quick images' or whatever.</p>
<p>The next change is the ability to quickly key through the blog list to select the target blog to post entries to. It'll give a quick notification via growl to let you know which one has been selected and is active.</p>
<p>The big feature addition to Fence in version 0.8 will be url TypeList support. Release 0.7 added the ability to distinguish between images, text posts and urls so to really take advantage of that users will now have the option of having urls dragged onto the app to be added to a selected url TypeList. This is the easiest way to make quick additions to your TypeList bookmarks to show what you are interested in and to review later for blogging. I do plan on adding more TypeList support in the future, but I'm starting small for now.</p><p>What is left to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li><strike>Update the Weblog and Gallery storage classes</strike></li>
<li><strike>Add dynamic weblog category discovery</strike></li>
<li>Add Bookmark/URL TypeList framework</li>
<li>Add dynamic TypeList discovery</li>
<li>Add TypeList item creation to AtomApi class</li>
</ul>
