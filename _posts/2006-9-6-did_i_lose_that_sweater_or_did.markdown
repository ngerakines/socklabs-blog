    Did I lose that sweater, or did it lose me?

I'm going to have a daughter soon. It some ways it feels like I already do. I talk to her, read to her, acknowledge that she is there and in many ways she's been with me through this entire experience. The way I see the world has radically changed in deep and profound ways over the short time that I've had to prepare for the rest of my life. I'm going to be a dad soon -- Something that I tell myself over and over again, each time affecting me just as much as the last time.

Perhaps no matter how much time is given and what else is going on, I'm not done digesting everything that is going on. I've had a lot of time for reflection and in the past few weeks I've gone out of my way to have some extra 'me' time just for that reason. Alas, with each new day come new things to consider and contemplate.

All of my life has brought me to this point. It is interesting to think that everything that I've done and gone through, everything that everyone has done that has impacted my life in large and small ways, has lead me to being a father. I can't help but acknowledge the huge presence of joy that fills me to think that. It feels like I've done soo much, but in retrospect it am overwhelmed by what I have yet to do.

Carolyn has done more for me than I could of ever imagined. Some people are lead to believe that when you get married you are emasculated but would like to state the contrary. Never have I met someone who has uplifted or strengthen me more. Waking up next to her every morning and spending our time together is one of the greatest blessing I've ever received. I never thought that being married would set me free.

I've got so much in store and I don't even know what it is. I'm really excited knowing that I've got the rest of my life to spend with Carolyn and child Vanessa.
