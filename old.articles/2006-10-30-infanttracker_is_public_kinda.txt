    InfantTracker is public (kinda)
---

Carolyn and I started what I call a family project recently. It is a web-app parents who want to be able to track their baby's feedings and diapers, among other things, online. It isn't web 2.0, it doesn't have tags, you can't meet anyone using it (in fact privacy is very strict) nor will it make the world a better place automagically through ajax and user experience.

<a href="http://www.infanttracker.com/">InfantTracker</a> is in public-beta so expect to see a very unpolished interface and bugs here and there. Toward the end of the week and over the weekend I'm hoping to get a lot more done so please let me know of your questions, comments and ideas.

I've also set up a <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/infanttracker/">project blog </a>for news and updates. <a href="http://www.infanttracker.com/">Check it out</a>!
