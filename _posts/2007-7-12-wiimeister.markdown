Well, maybe not so much. We've added a new game to our collection: Super Paper Mario. At first I thought that it was a kiddie game and that I might not enjoy it, but after getting through the first chapter I have changed my mind. Whoever was in charge of plot development and dialog is brilliant!

The game itself is a bit complex and hard to explain. As Mario, you are compelled to save the world from Count Bleck, an evil person bent on destroying the world (TM). You still have to work your way through levels in the traditional sense but the levels themselves are very different. Some of them are nothing but dialog and plot development, some of them strait-forward and others are 3D puzzles. In almost every level you can talk and interact with the world around you which adds a twist to the game.

You also get a number of helpers throughout the game. The first is a butterfly of sorts that lets you use the wiimote to scane for hidden or invisible things in the game. Another for bombs, another for turning paper thin, etc. Without them you can't complete the levels, hence they must be found and found in order.

I won't go to deep into the plot and dialog, but know that throughout the game I have laughed out loud.

We haven't finished the game yet but Carolyn is getting there. So far I really like the game.
