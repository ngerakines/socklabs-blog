Went to the optometrist, got glasses and a new prescription of contacts ( -2.25 left, -3.75 right, 8.7 curve on both)

Went to see <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/">Da Vinci Code</a> at the Shoreline theater.

Got some real quality time with <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/typepad-uploader/">Fence</a>. Will have release 0.7 ready soon.

Went to the bookstore on Castro, had a yummy mocha.

Rented half a dozen movies from Blockbuster. Aeon Flux was <em>very interesting</em> pretty good.

Gave some very deep thought to tagging, TypePad and rich blogging.

Finished off the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' cereal. It was tasty.

Updated the theme for <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/dadhood/">Dadhood blog</a>.

Finished up with our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html?id=2BETGEYW7OEG9">baby registry</a>.

Talked to Mom and Grandmother and made tentative arrangements for the youngest of my brothers, Ben and Charlie, to come out to SF for a week.

Updated my Mutt and Procmail configuration.

Thinking about blogging, user content and how users create content. Hammering out some details on <em>intuitive blogging</em>.
