    Sweet Serenity
---

This weekend I made it to the theater and finally saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a>. I had some poor expectations but they were completely wrong and it turned out to be great. I havn't seen any of the firefly series so I went into it blind although I've added them to my netflix queue now.
