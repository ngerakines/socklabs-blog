I didn't mention that toward the end of the road trip this weekend my nano broke. It looks like it was sat on, to be honest, because the screen is smashed inward.

As a replacement, I decided to get an ipod video. Tonight we went down to the apple store and picked one up. I got a black 30 gig and so far I'm happy. It really is much heavier in comparison and it just feels <em>different</em> in my hand, but its not bad.

I've already synced it with my music collection and I'll be on the prowl for more music soon. I think the time for a music pirating party is growing near.
