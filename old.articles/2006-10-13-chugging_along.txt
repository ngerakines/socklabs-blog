Life is good and the rewards are plenty, I've never been happier than this. Vanessa has her two week follow up and she is in good health. Carolyn is also feeling much better and everything is back to normal.

Today I got out of the house for an hour or so to head over to the shopping center. It is funny to think that even chores like running out to get cat litter feel like a small bit of relief and fresh air. I'm really not complaining either. I went over to the book store, got some jamba juice, got cat litter and even picked up some bagels for Carolyn. It was nice.

I slept much better last night and felt rested as I got out of bed. In fact this morning I really took my time to get back into my morning routine of waking up, picking clothes out for the day, showering, shaving and brushing my teeth. Even with Vanessa and all that is involved to take care of her, being able to keep your sense of 'normal' is really important.

We really didn't do a lot today, mostly cleaning and laundry. We were both talking about how much we would love to get out and see a movie tonight but we both know that it really isn't possible. The past few days we've been talking about what it would take and how to prepare for bottle feeding, but that bridge will be crossed when we get there.

Until then I am quite satisfied with our Tivo. Last night we watched Survivor and the night before we watched Lost. Once again Carolyn and I were talking about how much we Love being able to watch TV on our time. It makes all the difference.

I better get going though, I'm cooking dinner tonight.
