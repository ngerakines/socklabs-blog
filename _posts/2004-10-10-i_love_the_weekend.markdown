    I love the weekend

Life has been pretty good lately. At work we've been plenty busy preparing to roll out v3.0 and the upgraded shopping cart by November 1st. Igor has been really pushing the deadlines but Dan, Julie and I are pretty confident that we can get it working. We've already made leaps toward a finished product and the only thing left really is a bit of a polish for the execs.

Also alot on my mind about this job in West Hollywood. The group interview that Lisa, Dan, Julie and I went to went extremely well. We'll know by the end of this next week if they've decided to accept us or not but we are all very confident that they will. I'm probably going to be looking in Santa Monica or West Hollywood for a new place. I've found a couple on craigslist that look really appealing.

The second set of debates between Kerry and Bush was just a few nights ago. I think Bush did a great job of making himself look like a war monger again. I think Kerry has handled every situation very well and I'm eager to see him take up office in November. The girl I carpool with, Mai who is also an Avid Kerry supporter, and I always have long and heated discussions on the state of current affairs.

I just realized that I turn 21 in less than 2 weeks. Susan and I are going to the Ben Folds concert at the El Ray on the 21st and then to the club 'The Underground' where she said she has a 'suprise' in store. Hmmm. Anyway, back to code crunching. I have alot to do before the end of the day. Might take my laptop over to starbucks and work from there.
