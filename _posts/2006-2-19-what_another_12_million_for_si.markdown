    What? Another $12 million for Six Apart?
---

<a href="http://gigaom.com/">Om</a> speculates about my employer, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">SixApart</a>, getting another 12$ million in funding from a some mysterious venture capitalist. I have no idea what he's talking about, and I kinda like it that way. I can say this though, it really has no effect on the fact that SixApart is doing some real ass kicking in the blogging world.

I don't have to say that SixApart has been booming lately. At the office there is a real good feeling in the air. The project that I'm working on, <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a>, is getting better and better. Our release cycle has been tightened and we've got new features, updates and service enhancements rolling out every few weeks. We all feel really good about our product and where it is going.

<a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">MovableType</a> and <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/comet/">Project Comet</a> are pushing strong to really bring bloggers what they want: Creative expression. That is really what this is all about. Letting bloggers write about what they want, in whatever style or way they want to.
