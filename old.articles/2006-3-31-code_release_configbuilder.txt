    Code Release: Config::Builder
---

Today I push another module; <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Config-Builder">Config::Builder</a>. Its purpose is to create an easy way of managing multiple and configuration files by using dictionaries and rulesets to create simplified configuration.

It is YAML-centric but I'd really like to have it actively translate configuration into many formats. It's current version is 0.03 and I don't have a roadmap or anything for it but because of the need for it, it will be actively developed.

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/">Check out my other modules.</a>

I'd also like to point out that this module is housed at <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/">code.sixapart.com</a>. Its subversion repository can be found here: <a href="http://code.sixapart.com/svn/Config-Builder/">http://code.sixapart.com/svn/Config-Builder/</a>
