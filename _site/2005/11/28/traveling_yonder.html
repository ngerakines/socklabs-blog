		 	<p>Sunday was an eventful day. It was the last of my thanksgiving break and I decided to drive up from SoCal to San Francisco with Tom. For those of you who have not met, Tom is my 1966 Ford Mustang. I got him shortly after I turned 18 and we've been inseparable every since.</p>

<p>I hadn't really planned a route or track but knew that for the most part I would be headed northwest. The trip start at the Gepford house in Victorville and ended at the Armstrong residence about 9 hours later. I took the 18 to the 395 to the 58 to the 99 to the 146 to the 5 to the 152 to the 101 to the 85 and then finally to the 87. It was a beautiful trip. I got some really great pictures along the way.</p>

<p>Most notable is the good gas millage. The entire trip was a little over 300 miles but I only put about 50 dollars in gas in. After doing some math, it came to be that Tom was getting about 22 miles to the gallon. All in all, I'm pretty darn impressed.</p>

<p>The only down side was the blistering cold weather. I tried leaving so that I'd do most of the traveling during the day and in the sun, but with holiday traffic and such, most of the drive was at night. Tom has no a/c or heating and I had several layers of cloths on and was still freezing my socks off. From that I think I'm coming down with a pretty bad cold.</p>

<p>Today I unpacked all of my things, mostly cloths and books, and brought him to a shop. The first one I found, on 15th, gave me a real bad vibe. The guy that I talked to was also being a real pompous jackass and actually made that statement <code>It looks like you want someplace that will be cheap</code> while I was talking to him. Needless to say, he didn't get my business. I had to restrain myself from letting him hear it.</p>

<p>The second place I found is on Bush right past Van Ness and before Polk. I brought it in and the lead mechanic was much more friendly. He also seemed a bit eager to work on it which kinda made me feel better.</p>

<p>Tom needs a lot of work, but it is mostly cosmetic. He is a really smooth ride and I have a lot of faith. I made it all the way from SoCal without any issues or problems and that gave me a lot of confidence. To keep the list short, the driver's side door needs the window mechanics fixed, the electrical involving the blinkers and internal lights, carpet needs to be replaced and the seats need to be replaced. It could also use a coat of paint.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm very very glad to have my car up here with me. It needs some work, but now I finally have the time and money to give him the attention he needs. Yay for my car!</p>
