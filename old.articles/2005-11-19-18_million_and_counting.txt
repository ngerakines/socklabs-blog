    18 Million and counting
---

About 10 minutes ago Feedster reached an all time high in feed counts. We now have over 18 million feeds in our database. When compared to other search engines it might now seem like a lot, but I can explain.

What most people don't know is that we don't store blog urls or website urls. We only store and track feeds. We also have an intricate system for determining url and feed variants to minimize duplicated content in our index. We also have a massive, and continually growing, spam filtering system including some very complex scoring and weighing to help filter out the spam from the ham.

Looking back through the internal stats, it is easy for one to see the huge amount of growth over time. A very rough figure to go by is that a month ago we were adding 1 million new feeds every 20 to 25 days and now we are adding roughly a million feeds every 12 to 14 days.

Feedster's 18th million feed was: <a href="http://www.doblog.com/weblog/myblog/6892">http://www.doblog.com/weblog/myblog/6892</a> ( <a href="http://www.doblog.com/weblog/RSSServlet?CMD=LATEST&userid=6892&TYPE=RSS_1_0">rss feed</a> ).
