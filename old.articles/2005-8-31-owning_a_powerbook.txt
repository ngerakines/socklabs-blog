    Owning a powerbook
---

I will officially say that I am a mac convert now. I've had my powerbook for 2 days now and I am completely in love with it. It has been exceptionally easy to use and configure and fits all of my needs. I love having the power of a *nix system sitting behind the sexy interface. I love having all of my applications working how I want with minimal configuration and effort. I have never found it easier to use a computer. Its just that simple.

With that said, I've got a small but growing list of tools and applications that I couldn't live without. These programs don't come with the standard installation so I thought them note worthy.

Adium. Adium is a multi network instant messaging client. It can handle nearly all of the major protocols as well as some extras like address book hooks and file transfers.

Ecto. Ecto is powerfull blogging application with ties to nearly all of the current blogging APIs.

QuickSilver. QuickSilver is an application launcher and then some. It is complete extensible via plugins and can handle just about any task.

NetNewswire. NetNewsWire is an rss aggregator and reader. It handles some very cool features like groups, smart groups, tabs and even internal viewing of feeds.

iTerm. iTerm is a terminal application that beats the socks off of the native terminal. It has tabs and can support AppleScript.

DarwinPorts. DarwinPorts is an apt-get/yum like tool that has a growing library of linux tools and applications that have been ported to OS X.

BitTorrent - This one should be obvious. Its great for distributing large files or sets of files like linux distrobutions, etc.

That is it for now. Sooner or later I'll revise this list and provide links and more information.
