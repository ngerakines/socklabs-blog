The latest TypePad release included some really cool FeedBurner integration which is getting a lot of good feedback. I'm surprised to admit that even some of the people whom I thought would nay-say were even slightly impressed by it. So far, so good -- And I'm feeling quite proud of myself.

Directly related to that, I've updated the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sock/Net-FeedBurner">Net::FeedBurner</a> module with the up-to-date code we are running on our end. The changes are minor but affect some functionality.
