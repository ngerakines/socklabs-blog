Home is where the car(s) is(are).

That statement holds very true with me. Now both the mustang and the grand am are with me in the bay. Its been a long time coming, but it is finally done.

On Sunday we made the long drive up from southern California to northern California. We made a few stops here and there but nothing over a 10 or 15 minute bathroom and snack break.

We made it into Alameda late on Sunday night and plopped into bed like stones sinking into water. Early this morning I somehow made it out of bed and back to Alameda to move everything from the truck to the storage unit and then to turn the truck in.

Going at it alone took forever, but by early afternoon I could say with pleasure the words <em>"I'm Done!"</em>.

Sooner or later I have to make <em>yet another</em> trip to the DMV to deal with grand am papers and stuff, but it won't be half the ordeal that the mustang was. Now all I need is a stable place to park the grand am.

Carolyn just got off of work and I'm at starbucks doing some blogging and hacking. Raining outside, but it is kinda nice. I'm really looking forward to sleep.
