    What I love about San Francisco
---

Its nearly 2:30 in the morning and there is some guy outside our house  screaming at the top of his lungs 'Give me my shit. Give me my shit mother fucker'. I'm surprised Suzie hasn't woken up and come out yet. Today has been eventful and I've gotten a lot done. Hung out with <a href="http://carolyn.socklabs.com/">Carolyn</a> a good bit but also got a good bit of work done.

These next two weeks look good. Thursday is a party with the folks attending Web 2.0. I'm really looking forward to that. Also on the 14th I'll be going to the <a href="http://www.slide.com/">Slide</a> launch party with Amanda. There is a good chance Chelsea might make a day trip up to SF for my birthday which will be very cool, but I'm also thinking of heading down to Florida or Houston to see some family for Thanksgiving. Halloween plans are fuzzy right now.

In the news today there was a <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N04504166.htm">mysterious virus</a> that killed 10 people in Toronto. How scary is that? I also heard that <a href="http://randomfoo.net/blog/id/4032">Yahoo acquired Upcoming.org</a>, a site that a friend of mine started, and it looks like <a href="http://randomfoo.net/">Leonard</a> and <a href="http://exothermia.net/ccc">Eric</a> will have the chance to work together.

Anyway, I better get some sleep.
