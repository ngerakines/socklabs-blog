    Importing feeds into Mail.app with OPML
---

<p>I've gone back and forth between Mail.app and other email readers and with Leopard I'm going to give the new version another go. I especially like the integrated todo list, notes and RSS feeds but what I havn't found is how to import rss feeds from an OPML file into Mail.app.</p>

<p>So I wrote a small perl script that does it for me.</p>

<form mt:asset-id="2" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file"><a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/rss_import.pl.txt">rss_import.pl.txt</a></form>

<p><br />
This script takes an OPML file, like one generated by exporting your feeds from Google Reader or the like, and imports those feeds into Mail.app. Using the script may take a little work as it requires the perl module XML::OPML::LibXML that doesn't come with the standard installation. Download, read the POD documentation for usage and description and enjoy.</p>
