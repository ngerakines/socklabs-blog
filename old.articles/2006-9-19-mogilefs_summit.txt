    MogileFS Summit
---

Today at SixApart I attended the MogileFS Summit that brad organized. There was a really good turn out and I met a lot of cool folks working on some awesome, and large, projects. I'll dig around and see if anyone posted notes or attendance.

I started thinking of a lot of plugin ideas for MogileFS 2.0 and if the timing is good I might even get to work on a few of them.
