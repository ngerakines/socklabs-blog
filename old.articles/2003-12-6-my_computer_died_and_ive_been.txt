    My computer died and i've been neglecting my journal
---

The past week has been very very hectic. For starters my computer bit the dirt pretty hard. I also got a cell phone. So woot for me. For all of those who i forget to give it to, don't be angry: 481 5596. Leaving out the area code because its the default for where i live. So yeah life is good. I tried upgrading my computer from mandrake 9.1 to 9.2 and it junked up. No fun at all. Arg, brb, upgrading kernel.
