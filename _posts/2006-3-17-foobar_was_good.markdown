    Foobar was good
---

Foobar was smoking hot tonight. Good company, good vibe. I really love being able to just hang out. Its been especially hectic the past few weeks and it doesn't look like its going to go away until we hit release 1.x.x :D.

Rachel and I had lunch today and did our annual catch-up. She's such a cool chic.

I was supposed to have dinner with a friend over in Freemont but Carolyn had to work tonight and we've pushed it to lunch tomorrow instead.

She gets off of work pretty soon so I think we are going to catch <em>V for Vendetta</em> tonight at the Metreon instead. Not sure how it will go really, but my hopes are high.
