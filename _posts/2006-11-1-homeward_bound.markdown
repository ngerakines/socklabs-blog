I just left the SixApart office, quite possibly, for the last time. Today was my last day with SixApart and I'm heading home feeling good. Its been a beautiful day, albeit a little cold, and I've had the opportunity to say goodbye and good luck to the many intelligent and gifted people that I've had the pleasure working with.

Now I have a little time to be a full-time dad again before I start a new job. Carolyn is looking forward to a little extra help the next week or two and I'm happy about it myself.

Last night was a bit of a disappointment. Not one trick-or-treater knocked on the door or rang the bell. Now we have a boat load of candy to 'get rid of' without making ourselves sick. Carolyn did dress Vanessa up in her pumpkin costume and took a few really cute pictures. Picasso even made an appearance in his spider-man costume. Disclaimer: I had nothing to do with dressing up the cat.

I think over the next few days I'm going to spend some more time working on <a href="http://www.infanttracker.com/">InfantTracker</a> and some MT plugins that I started. Recently I also configure a squid server to sit in front of <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/">my blog</a> to help with caching some of the dynamic tag-related functionality so I think I'll also write about how I got that working as well.
