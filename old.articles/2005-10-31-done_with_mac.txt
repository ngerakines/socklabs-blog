    Done with .mac

Well, my grace period is over with my .mac account. I'm not entirely sure if I want to renew it though. Although having it wasn't bad, I really didn't use it all that much. I used the email address but didn't actually touch any of the web services or syncing tools.

It was nice, but it wasn't good enough to pay for.
