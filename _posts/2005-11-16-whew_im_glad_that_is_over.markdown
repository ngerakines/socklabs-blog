    Whew, I'm glad that is over.

The latest news, or just late news, is that the UN will <i>not</i> be destroying the internet as previously threatened. Apparently there was a very productive meeting on the subject and it went very well for all parties. Here are the minutes of the meeting:

<blockquote>
World: We want to control the internet.<br />
USA: No.<br />
World: Come on!<br />
USA: No.<br />
World: Will you at least think about it?<br />
USA: No.<br />
World: If you don't we will be forced to make our own DNS systems.<br />
USA: OK.<br />
World: But that will break the internet.<br />
USA: OK<br />
World: But that would be bad.<br />
USA: Then leave it alone.<br />
World: OK. But we're making a committee.<br />
USA: That's cute.
