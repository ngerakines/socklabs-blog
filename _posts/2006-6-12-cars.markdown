This weekend Carolyn and I went to see the movie <em>Cars</em>. I was a lot more entertained than I thought I would be given that it was without a doubt a kids movie. I did notice one thing that struck me as interesting though, there wasn't a single preview for a movie with real people in it as opposed to CG.
