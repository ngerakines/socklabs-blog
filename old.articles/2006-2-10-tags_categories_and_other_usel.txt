I've got a few Technorati watchlists for major keywords like 'SixApart' and 'Movable Type'. One of them turned up an interesting read: <a href="http://glorious.blogs.com/glorious/2006/02/its_useless_to_.html">http://glorious.blogs.com/glorious/2006/02/its_useless_to_.html</a>

This got me thinking as to how much redundancy there is in the blogosphere. I've started keeping my eyes open as to how much content is republished over and over again and how eaisly people will put the same thing out repeatedly just for another click. Kinda makes you wonder.
