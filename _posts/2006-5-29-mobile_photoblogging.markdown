Memorial day is almost over and I'm getting ready for bed soon. This afternoon we had dinner with family and I thought it went very nicely. Before we left however, I setup my <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/mobile/">mobile photoblog</a> and played around with the themes and such.

Tonight I have planned some <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/typepad-upload/">Fence</a> hacking and testing. I'd like to hammer out category support before I hit the sack. I've already got it mapped out in my head, so now I just need to commit to code and debug.
