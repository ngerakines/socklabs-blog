    Hurricane Relief

If you have not done so already, please consider giving to one of the many organizations providing relief and support to the survivors of hurricane Katrina. The storm itself might have passed but thousands of people have been misplaced and have lost everything they own. Please show your support.

If you are from the area and want to let your friends and family that you are ok, please register with <a href="http://www.familylinks.icrc.org/katrina/locate">the missing persons list</a>.
