title: January SF Erlounge at EASF-Rupture
---

Last week I announced on the [Erlang Questions mailing list](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/) that we'd be hosting an [SF Erlounge at  EASF-Rupture in mid-January](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2008-December/040541.html). The event will be from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm at our office 2nd street. Erlang developers, enthusiasts and the curious are invited to this social meetup. We'll be providing light snacks and drinks with the idea that we'll be going out dinner afterward.

This event is open to the public but space is limited.

We are located at Harrison St & 2nd St, just a few blocks north of
South Park, south of Market St. Our office is a comfortable 10 minute
walk from the Caltrain station for anyone in the south-bay who would
like to attend.

    400 2nd Street, Suite 350
