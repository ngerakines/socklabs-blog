    Snakes on a plane
---

This weekend has been quite nice given everything that went on. Friday was our last and final <em>childbirth preparation class</em> and I am very happy for that. We also made tentative plans to have dinner with one of the couples from class and that'll happen sometime next week (or weekend).

We did a lot of cleaning on Saturday. We put up some shelves and organized a little. While we were out during the day we got new bed linens from <em>Bed, Bath and Beyond</em>. I really like them, they are green. Our dishwasher is broken so I've been doing a lot of dishes lately. The evening itself was eventful, for better or worse, but it simmered down and we eventually conked out.

Today Carolyn went over to her mom's house to see her new kittens (Joey and Charlie -- both orange tabbies and very cute from what I hear). I opted to stay home and continue cleaning (it never ends -- I got a lot done!). I sent Sharon a Vox invite so maybe she'll accept it and post some pictures of them  something soon *nudge nudge*.

By the time Carolyn got home I was getting pretty hungry so we left to get dinner and see about a movie. We went over to Saratoga and Prospect in San Jose to get dinner and then saw the movie Snakes on a Plane.

I thought very highly of the movie. I really had my heart set on seeing it last weekend but with our unexpected trip to the hospital it was, of course, delayed for much more important things. Carolyn said that her first thought was that the movie was going to really suck and I got the impression that the only way she would ever see it is if I wanted to go in the first place. When we left the theater she had a smile and we both enjoyed ourselves. There were times that I thought it was a bit gross but for the most part it was funny and entertaining. It was definitely worth seeing. After the movie we both got some ice cream and headed home. All that is left for tonight is to do some laundry and get ready for bed.
