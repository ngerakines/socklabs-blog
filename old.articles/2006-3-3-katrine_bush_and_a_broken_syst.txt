    Katrina, Bush and A Broken System
---

There was an interesting read on <a href="http://tailrank.com/">TailRank</a> about a speech that President Bush made only 3 days after Katrina had wiped most of New Orleans off of the map. He was quoted saying "<em>I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.</em>". Ironically, there was a pre-storm video of 'officials' warning Bush during a meeting that Katrina posed a huge threat to the city and the levees would probably not hold.

It is obvious that there was consistent breakdown and confusion in the 'authority' that was heading disaster preparation and recovery. The situation is especially infuriating considering the loss of life and property. And through all of this, they still play the blame game and <em>refuse to take responsibility</em> for the <b>failure to act</b>.

BAH!
