		 	<p>Early in the evening last night there was an earth quake that measured a 7.0 off the coast of northern california that prompted a tsunami warning for Oregon and California. A friend of mine called me up and told me about it. I jumped onto <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/">Yahoo News</a> which had a small red bar declaring that the emergency broadcast system was on and in place. It was kinda scary at first but then realized that we, being so far south, were probly not in the threat range.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was occupied by trying to get <code>World of Warcraft</code> back up to speed after the most recent patch. When I signed into the game I noticed the 1.5.1 patch and after installing it found that it left my system shaky. Some of the wierd effects are not being able to target <em>anything</em> and the game freezing after casting certain spells. Needless to say I'm not to impressed. I ended up jumping on Corey's machine and played around a bit. We are all going to start a guild and the name we've chosen so far is <em>Wild Stallions</em>, after the pious Bill and Ted. I can change the guild name at any time so lets see how long this idea lasts.</p>

<p>I talked to Chelsea yesterday as well. She sounds miserable up in the desert and gives the serious impression that she wants to get out of there badly and go back to Orange. I'm glad she moved out, don't get me wrong, but she could of found roommates or something other than going home. I've got a lot of deeper thoughts and opinions about the situation but for now I'll keep them to myself.</p>

<p>Aaron and Brandi are really excited about me coming down to New Orleans in July. I got tickets about a month ago while talking to Emily online. I'm very happy about seeing both my newly discovered family members as well as my old friends. My trip is nearly 3 weeks away and I'm already ready to step on a plane today.</p>

<p>Work is going well despite alot of issues floating around. We've been adding new sources to <a href="http://www.newsalerts.com/">NewsAlerts</a> and its a tedious process of adjusting our internals and configuration accordingly. I'm just happy to see that we now use Wired as one of our sources. I'm a big fan of there publications already, this just helps that out. Some of the others on the list is <code>The Christian Science Monitor</code>, CBS News, Canada something or another and a few more. About 20 on the list in total.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bookmarks.com/">Bookmarks.com</a> is on hold at the moment until NewsAlerts and BlogSource are fully up to speed with the specs and roadmap. Its kinda sad but it has to happen. I can gladly say though that I'm very happy that its reached its <strong>Beta Milestone</strong> and is looking quite good.</p>

<p>Today: Meetings</p>

<p>Tomorrow: The world</p>
