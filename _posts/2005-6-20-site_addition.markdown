This website now has an expanded bookmarking service added to its features list. The address is <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/">bookmarks.socklabs.com</a> for those who curious. The features are pretty basic but the entire system is pretty flexible. The idea is that there is no actual html generated by the engine, only xml. That xml is then has a stylesheet applied to it for viewing. Currently it has xhml, <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/?d=rss">rss</a> and <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/?d=xbel">xbel</a> stylesheets and there is always the option to view the <a href="http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/?d=raw">raw data</a>.

This sort of open data api lets us do some very cool things with it. Creating plugins and applications for it is much easier. Consider a desktop application for managing your bookmarks. There is no need for scraping or complex calls to fetch data. Its as easy as grabbing the xml absorbing it in the application. Submitting information is as easy as a post request. Having the ability to export the xml also lets others fetch and render the information any way they like it.

Its more of a personal service that I can use as a reference while blogging but it makes managing my bookmarks alot easier. Now all I have to do is send a tag link to someone when talking about a given subject instead of trying to copy and paste a bunch of links. I'm not looking to replace del.icio.us or anything, just make life a bit easier.

The idea is that I'd like to create a series of applications that all opperate with this basic idea. Because they all generate and read xml it would make it easier to intigrate them all as well. I can think of a lot of ways this could tie in with other web apps.

Sign up if you are curious and have fun with it.
