My name is Nick Gerakines and this is my blog. I'm a native new-orleanian turned californian and have lived on the west coast since mid 2001. I love to program, write and spend time with my family. One of my recent works is "[Facebook Application Development](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470246669/socklabs-20)" (John Wiley & Sons, Inc, published 2008).

I'm pretty active on the usual social facets including [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/snipersock/), [twitter](http://twitter.com/ngerakines), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/Nick_Gerakines/500025891), [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/sock) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ngerakines). I prefer [email](mailto:nick@gerakines.net) over instant messaging but will also respond to Facebook messages.

I'm a regular open source software contributor. I [maintain and contribute to](http://github.com/ngerakines) several projects and have earned the prestigious **Hardcore Forker of the Week** title on GitHub.

From time to time you can find me on [Medivh-US](http://apps.facebook.com/iplaywow/realm/Medivh-US) playing the World of Warcraft character [Korale](http://apps.facebook.com/iplaywow/character/Medivh-US/Korale). I've been featured on one of [WoW Insider's 15 Minutes of Fame](http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/02/04/15-minutes-of-fame-i-play-wow-for-facebook/) as well as [a few](http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/07/08/i-play-wow-on-facebook/) [others](http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/01/16/i-play-wow-facebook-app-reaches-100-000-users/).
