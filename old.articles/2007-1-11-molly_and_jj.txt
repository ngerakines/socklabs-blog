    Molly and JJ
---

I found out a bit before the new year that my cousin Molly and her husband JJ would be moving to Palo Alto in early January. I talked to her briefly yesterday and found out that they recently got out here but the moving truck has had serious delays. I can only imagine how much it would suck having to live out of a hotel while waiting on something like this.

I'm really excited about having someone from my side of the family out here.
