<a href="http://gallery.socklabs.com/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=203"><img style="margin: 5px" align="right" src="http://gallery.socklabs.com/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=204&g2_serialNumber=2" border="0"/></a> Its finally happening. I'm going to guess that <a href="http://www.wizards.com/">Wizards of the Coast</a> is starting to realize that MMORPGs are going to start hitting the D&D player base. Being a bit of a role playing geek and having my share a few years ago, I find this ad extremely funny.

As quoted from the ad:<blockquote><i>If you're going to sit in your basement pretending to be an elf, you should at least have some friends over to help.</i></blockquote>
