title: iPad

For the 3rd time I've been really close to getting an iPad but backed out. The problem is that I just can't justify getting one. I'm not talking about convincing Carolyn or about justifying the price, but the internal "do I really need this" conversation that often gets ignored. I've got plenty of reasons to get one including, but not limited to ...

* Back in February I lost my iPhone in an airport and have been smartphone-less ever since. I ended up getting a cheap, crappy phone off of ebay that is so old it says Cingular on it.
* I have a first generation Kindle and really love reading books, something that people tell me you can do on the iPad. Granted, my Kindle isn't dead or anything, it is another task that I could do with it.
* I'm averaging about 3 technical presentations a month and I think the iPad would be able to help with that. Whether its using it as a (short) note taking device or using it for a presentation, I could probably get good millage out of it.
* There are a lot of apps out there and, although this sounds really dumb and makes me sound like yet another mindless consumer, I don't know what I need yet.

What is frustrating is that every time I think of another reason to get one, I can easily come up with a counter point. The two main contenders are "You've already got something that does that but better." or "You've been living without feature XYZ and you can continue to live without it."
