    Representing bookmarks via atom
---

There have been numerous ways of representing bookmarks and url collections. I've seen everything from rdf, xbel and numerous microformats to opml. Recently there was an interesting thread on the atom-syntax working group about <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg19607.html">using atom to represent a bookmark or list of bookmarks</a>. Being a fan of atom and what it is capable of, I really like this idea and hope it is carried forward.

I saw <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/code/delicious-atom/">this page</a> which has an xslt style sheet that can convert the current delicious api to atom. I think it needs to be updated and there is a lot of meta-data that could be included but its a great start.
