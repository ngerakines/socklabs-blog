Last night she went down quicker than I thought she would. Given the past few nights things weren't looking up. Alas, she went to sleep before 1:00 am and I got a decent amount of sleep and woke up feeling rested.

I'm thinking of changing my blog theme again. I'm having a hard time settling with one design that I really really like. I picked this one from The Style Contest and have liked it alot so far, but I'd really like something of my own.
